What can be done differently? Keep to the agenda. In particular where a question is asked during the presentation I'm able to quickly address that, or if required come back to it, and then continue with the presentation, rather than feeling I have to re-arrange the presentation as a result of that question. In the future this will allow me to focus on addressing the key points of the presentation.

One of my goals for this project is to become better at retrospection.

When I received the news about the team structures, it was a surprise. I had expected that the teams would be location based. I have some concerns about lining up times to collaborate as previous online collaboration I have been involved with (i.e. university) has been difficult. The fact that I will be working with people from different locations is also one of the things I am most looking forward to as there will be a variety of experiences to draw from.

Some of them about myself, my capabilities my knowledge and my skills and some many others about Deloitte, its many industries and what change can I possible do to it. 

Over this experience I am hoping to further develop skills I currently have and develop new ones. 

I am eager to improve my public speaking since I find myself to be a very confident speaker when on a small group but I quickly become quite when presenting in larger groups. I am also excited to develop an idea in a group setting and manage typical conflict in an efficient and effective manner. I am often not a strong leader, which I hope I can improve over my time in this challenge, however not everyone is a natural leader but I am hoping to learn new skills that will improve my involvement with a team. 

As per experience, I have limited. Although I have participated in many group presentations at work and at University I have never had the chance to develop and idea in a group setting for a company. This is mostly because at University the idea is often given to us already. However I am familiar with working with people who have different ideas and I find I manage that very easily. I personally enjoy hearing others people ideas and thoughts and building in each other’s concepts and often find myself being the intermediate between those who want to share their ideas and those reluctant to listen. I believe to be very talented at customer service and counselling which have been my areas of work and study. I am hoping this skills will be of use when working together with my team, Deloitte and Macquarie. 

I would really appreciate some feedback regarding this reflection as I struggle to characterize myself with ‘skills’ and I often get off-track when trying to answer specific questions.

* Identify the underlying problem(s) within issues, and construct solutions that are relevant to a business context (i.e. Deloitte) are economically viable and are logical.
*Develop skills in which issues are observed through different perspectives, allowing innovative solutions to be developed
*Improve efficiency and and enhance my communication skills within a teamwork environment
*Understand and learn from my failures, in order to progress and to perform to the best of my ability
*Attract my ideas to a wide audience through improving communication and persuasion skills

Skills that I have that I believe will contribute to the this project include:

*Communicating ideas to team members
*Thinking outside the square when needed to solve challenging issues
*Completing tasks punctually, without compromising quality
*Being open to other people's ideas by listening to other people's perspectives on an issue
*Ability to analyse an issue and discovering different pathways to solve the issue

Previous experiences I believe that will be useful for this project include:

*Holding Treasurer position for the Association of  Dunmore Lang College Students (ADS), Macquarie University in 2014 - Required me to engage and communicate effectively with team members, solve issues relating to allocation of expenses towards committees at the college given a certain budget, praising team members for excellent effort, organising and communicating information to the students of the college, leadership through assertiveness and encouraging others to perform specific tasks, being honest with the provision and use of funds, recording information in a database and reporting that data in a logical manner so that it was easily readable by others. 

*Belonging to sporting teams. Was part of the Lindfield Rugby Club Under 21s rugby union squad in 2014. Required effective teamwork and communication skills on and off the pitch.
 

Potential challenges that may arise:

*Conflicts between team members - lack of understanding of project that needs to be completed.

*Ideas not communicated effectively, leading to misunderstandings by business people to whom we will pitch our ideas to

*Hardship in finding an innovative solution to the problem at hand

These include being able to actively engage in a professional organisation which includes learning the do's and dont's when working in a professional environment. These skills encompass gaining an understanding of what the business environment is like as well as learning how to cope in stressful situations in a professional business context rather than in situations such as University or School. This point is really important, as a student of psychology I have studied the stats that reveal a significant population that are unsatisfied are largely so due to their work. This can be due to unrealistic work expectations placed on themselves or by their employers. Hence gaining even a small understanding through observing and talking to like minded professionals I can possibly gain a better understanding and adjust expectations so that I may be better prepared and have a realistic view of what it is like to work in a corporate job before actually working in one.
I also want to further develop how to effectively communicate to professionals in the industry as well as team members. Other skills include being able to work in a team effectively, being able to create ideas that are ethically and socially responsible as a group and individually. I believe this is important to innovating a good product/service as well as being successful in any job that I may have in the future. This brings me to another skill that i wish to develop which is critical thinking and analysis. The course is based on a challenge for teams that can create an idea that is worth ""$50+ million"". Hence I wish to learn how to synthesize and collate the relevant information needed to produce a sound if not outstanding product or service, put simply the skill to innovate. Beau Leese, the General Manager for Strategy, Performance and International for Deloitte offers insight as to how one can learn or increase the chances of success when innovating in an intrapreneurial context by implementing Scientific Method. Therefore I want to be able to learn how to create a good idea by ""failing cheaply and failing quickly"" so that I may learn how to succeed. Furthermore I want to be able to learn to take principles that I have learnt in the classroom whether they be psychological principles or Economic Theory such as Hofstede's Cultural dimensions or Demand/Supply and apply these concepts to the real world. Lastly, learning how to self reflect is an important skill to check progress as well as to have continued progress. I hope that my Self Reflection as this course progresses gets better.                                                                                                                                                                                    Some Skills and Experiences that I can contribute to this project includes my experience talking and engaging with clients as an Entrepreneur. As discussed in the induction we are expected to talk to industry professionals when developing our idea and hopefully I may be able to offer insight how to go about communicating to people that work in a corporate organisation. In addition, as a student I have always prided my excellent time management skills and leadership skills especially when working in a team hence I can help organise roles(if the team wants me too) and organise meetings. Overall I do believe that I have many skills that I can contribute to the project but I definitely think I have a lot more to gain and learn from this experience.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I am hoping to develop all these skills through a continuous cycle of critique and improvement. 

Objective rationality is the ability to put aside personal bias and to be able to, step-by-step, think through an idea to ensure that it has the ability to work. I took a longer than expected time submitting my first idea to the creation zone primarily due to this entrepreneurial feature. Being able to handle criticism goes hand in hand with objective rationality, and I understand that I too passionately defend what I say, even if I know I may not be correct initially. I tend to end up convincing myself. My goal recently, even before the Fastrack challenge, is to completely hear out what people have to say and adopt the principle of charity, which is trying to rationalise points that I do not initially agree with. This is important as obviously people are rational and have their own logical reasons for what they say. I am actually surprised of the lack of criticism I received from my initial idea post, but I think I assumed the worst. I need to be more open with what I have to say, as not everyone will immediately hate it. I also need to understand that hate is the wrong word, that people may differ their views to mine for the end goal of improving my logic. 

I believe I possess decent communication and creativity skills, but I do want to improve them. My form of creativity is definitely not art related, it is the ability to think of ideas on the fly and then through copious amounts of research, evaluate and then decide whether or not the idea is worth pursuing. A strength of mine is being able to do long and uninterrupted periods research. My previous research internship at Macquarie University and my law degree have contributed to this, as both showed me that ideas alone are superficial. It is only when you can backup ideas with evidence that they become worth something. This is why I am looking so forward to the next stage the program where groups are formed and ideas and thoroughly looked at. 

The main challenge I personally believe I will face, that happens to also be a skill and that stems off my aforementioned cynicism, is the ability to relentlessly defend a losing or attack a winning argument. This is something I am not proud of, however it has its merits. Once the next few stages of the program begin, I feel confident that I will be able to point out the flaws of potential ideas. My goal though, as previously mentioned, is to do this in a friendly and constructive manner. If the conversation about idea flaws occurs in person, I will be sure to speak in a friendly and empathetic manner. If it happens online, I will proof read my text to ensure that the message gets communicated in my intended manner. I believe I will overcome this and improve my communication skills.

I hope to develop a process of analysing real world projects in terms of viability and efficacy. Real world projects often must meet more than just supposition. They must meet a certain need or issue whether that be from clients whom work with Deloitte or events that affect local and global societies. Ideas and projects are critical, however forming the skills necessary to realize such projects is what I hope to gain from this experience.
Skills involved may include communication with team members, communication with clients, iterating on mistakes or failures and working through a real process of beginning with an idea and constructing a prototype, complete with timelines and workflow. It will be interesting to see how to combine economic theory with real world events, particularly how such theory informs which sectors to pursue. 
From the Deloitte debrief on forward looking endeavours, it is clear that focus should be on the five sectors of key growth and comparative advantage Australia possesses. Ideas should stem from these areas to influence growth through innovation. A key learning tool here is creativity, a concept sorely lacking in my university experience thus far. This poses a challenge of percolating new ideas in sectors that I am not entirely familiar with, but hopefully will give me an opportunity to venture into. 
Looking through the resource bank on the Practera website as well as the Ideazone, creativity and ideas should be informed through research and viability. Elements here remain unfamiliar, however the essence of what they are asking is really ‘give us any simple idea’. It seems like a challenge, however I believe it lies more in the theoretical space of viability and creativity. It seems best to focus on the needs of the client as well as leveraging our strengths as a corporation/country in order to formulate a solution, regardless of the sector. 
Reflection is an area that I would be pleased to implement as a personal progress metric. To look back on areas that need most work as well as areas that have been successful is a useful skill that is generally assumed people possess. While not a regular personal practice, this Fastrack challenge emphasizes early failure and iteration. reflection is paramount. 
There are many skills and concepts I hope to be able to integrate within this experience, perhaps more so than skills I can potentially bring. I remain anxious yet intrigued about my time in this challenge.
Skills I can contribute:
My background is mainly from a theoretical perspective. Most of my experience lies within academia or university coursework. This would include analysing trends within the micro and macroeconomic climate, the greater effect interest rates have on currency, and how businesses react or behave in response to changes in macro policy as well as considering projects on a macro scale. I also have experience working within an academic team context due to prior experiences with PACE activities. I hope to offer an approachable style to reviewing ideas or work with colleagues and adapting to various perspectives that will come about over the course of team collaboration. I have a broad experience with learning how to share/update work across different media so colleagues are able to collaborate with greater ease.

Last but not least, I hope to have a better grasp on time management. I suppose time management is a skill that everyone constantly struggles with, some more than others. And I am afraid that I am part of the latter. With this experience, I hope that my time management will improve. 

Being the middle child between two other siblings, I have often been posed as the mediator between their arguments. With that, I hope that should any disagreement arise between our team members, I am able to use that skill to diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand.

Also the marketing concepts and techniques which I have learnt in the classroom will be applied to the best of my ability to help the project develop and grow.

I would also like to build on my confidence in these kinds of settings and not look at them as intimidating. Rather than just following rules and instructions given by a lecturer I am hoping this experience will give me the skills to be able to take better initiative. 

I am currently in an executive position on a student association. Through this experience I have learnt a lot about teamwork and actually executing ideas and plans. I feel as though I have skills in working out alternatives when something goes wrong and also have gained strong leadership skills through this role. However in saying this I feel this experience has also taught me areas I need to improve on. Particularly the way I handle criticisms and contradicting ideas/views. I am hoping this course will assist in helping me improve this and be able to take criticisms in a more constructive manner.

I feel my interpersonal skills are also very strong. Living in a residential college with 300 people from around the world has really developed my understanding of differences in cultures and personalities. I think I am definitely a people person, who is able to get along with anyone for the sake of a mutual project. 

Potential challenges I feel that could arise from this course, is just having people put in effort. Its very disheartening when you put in all the effort and don't get the credit for it.

Not just that alone, but also to master the skills of working within a team as it is so important to myself that I can develop these and better myself to become an employable asset to an employer. I believe my communication skills are fairly good but I know I can do even better by practicing through real life situations such as the project that I'll be understanding with strangers. Likewise with presenting to people, I feel anxious and nervous that I may stutter and it becomes a self for filling prophecy and so I hope to not only develop better skills in presenting to people in general but also to build self-confidence so that I can give a flawless presentation. Teamwork is a skill I believe I do well but I do not enjoy it due to being permanently stuck with individuals who do not share my desire, I believe during this course I will be able to cope and treat the need for teamwork in a differing manner than when I first joined this course. 

I bring experience with different cultures and backgrounds from work but also through my extracurricular activities. This will be valuable when dealing with team members, as I will not prejudge those in the team and provide empathy rather than neglect the member and form hatred towards them for perhaps not contributing. I believe my communication skills will also be able to contribute to the project, as I am able to communicate clearly and succinctly whatever is needed to be communicated to others. Also my researching skills are superior as I have gained these through tertiary assignments and will be invaluable as to contribute to the researching of topics and ideas to collaborate with other team members.

I see repeated failure as a potential challenge of this experience, something I have not had to deal with a lot in the past. Other possible challenges include juggling commitments, making deadlines, and communicating effectively. 

Currently, I feel oppressed and cornered when asked to talk about my goals and plans for the future. As I near closer to Graduation, I feel I still cannot speak well of my strengths and specialties. I hope that this experience can help me feel more comfortable when I need to do so in future.

I've had ideas in the past that my father and I have researched, yet I've never felt that I've maximised my time spent in speaking with the potential customer on what they believe can help solve a problem I am trying to address. This is undoubtedly the most pivotal point in constructing a viable business plan. At the end of the day, I'm not buying my idea, so I wish to move away from this mind frame that I have struck a level of genius that doesn't require altering or shaping to grow in to a liable commercial business. I believe working in a team will help me begin to achieve this in the first instance. In the past I have been very defensive of my ideas and have kept them a secret to grow on my own and from the help of close, trusted people. However, upon my experience on exchange at UNC Chapel Hill in the United States, my professor for entrepreneurship was adamant about the fact that ideas must be shared to be fully realised. I wish to take this mentality in to the Deloitte program to really open myself up to developing communication skills with potential customers and clients. 

As it may appear above, I have studied a level of entrepreneurship formally at University in the United States at one of the most recoginsed business schools in North America (the Kenan-Flaglar Business School). I believe this will help contribute to the concept of ""intrapreneurship"" that is being taught at Deloitte. Whilst intrapreneurship is focused on innovation within an existing firm, it undoubtedly shares many of the same principles as entrepreneurship such as the lean growth model, minimally viable products and a series of other theories discussed within this milestone. Having a formal understanding of the study of incubating an idea and transforming it in to a commercial proposition is a valuable start point that I look to utilise.

Initially enrolling into the program I had a basic idea of it being an opportunity to network and basically obtain a work experience at Deloitte. These was quite exciting, as I would be provided with an opportunity to work with the Big 4. However that was not the case when I attended the first introductory meeting. During the first introductory meeting I was exposed to the ideas of how this course would provide learning experiences such as networking, teamwork and innovative thinking. These ideas at first sounded like any other course. Nonetheless as the seminar went on, the ideas became clearer and effective for me to address my weaknesses of communication and innovative thinking. Therefore the main skills I hope to develop is networking through improvement in communication skills and innovative thinking. Through the mentorship element of the course, I hope to obtain knowledge and experience around client communication and professionalism. This learning process would certainly improve my communication skills and help address my weakness. Furthermore, I would want develop my innovative thinking. As explained during the seminar, Ideazone of Practera would provide an online platform for peers to share and comment on each other’s ideas. This form of experience, helps an individual to improve their innovative thinking and strengthen their idea even further through peer communication. I hope to expand and strengthen my innovative thinking with the help of my peers. 

What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?

Having had worked in a team environment before, such as university projects and audit teams, I would be able to contribute my experience of planning, organisation, management and teamwork. I believe these skills are important in the development of the innovative idea and succeeding in communicating it to the stakeholders. Planning, organisation and management are skills required in setting out the workflow of the project. As learnt from the videos on Practera, for performance improvement, it is important to manage a project well. Therefore by providing these skills I hope to help others and also further my experiences in these skills to assist me in future endeavours. Teamwork is also an important skill I can provide. Having had gone through the cycle of forming, storming, norming and performing through various group projects, I believe I would be able to provide a learning experience for my peers and also grow in experience of it to further my skills. 

What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?

Two of the major challenges that is experience provides is management and teamwork. Time management and organisation would be key to the success of this project. Having a proper plan in place from start to finish would assist in the efficient completion of the project. Therefore from this challenge, I would like to grow my skills of planning and organisation. Furthermore teamwork would be another challenge. The challenge within teamwork would be communication and work management. Given the program is selective, there would be individuals from different backgrounds and would be quite opinionated. Therefore it is important to have good communication skills and tolerance for different opinions. Through this challenge I would therefore want to improve my skill of effectively communicating with individuals in my group in order to reach a consensus

By doing this course, I have to do the tasks with my teammates, we might have different opinions when discussing the ideas and it is important for us to respect each other and listen to others’ ideas.
Besides, I wish to develop my innovation skills. It is because we cannot get a great improvement if we lack of the ability to create some new ideas or an ability to solve problems and manage the risks. In this course, I would have a great chance to do lots of brainstorming activities in order to suggest some ideas to Deloitte. It is a challenging task to me, but I believe it will help me notice the little things in life as ideas can be arose from anytime and everywhere.
I was a winter trainee at PwC Hong Kong in last winter. I had to work within a team, our team leader allocated different tasks to each team members. Although we were doing the different tasks, we would still share all our thoughts to each other and helped others if anyone in the team found a problem in order to make sure everything was in schedule. I have improved my interpersonal skills and time management skills in this internship. I think I can contribute these skills to this project since it is important to make sure everyone in the team are participating so we can have different brand new ideas and thus we can conclude the best one to finish our project. Also, we should have a planning activity before we start doing the tasks and it should states every steps and deadline clearly, so we can make sure that we could finish the tasks on time.
In this course, I think there are two different potential challenges will arise over the course. The first one is the language. Since my first language is not English, it might affect the ability of the communications between my teammates and me, we might misunderstand each other during the discussion. The second one is there might be some uncooperative members in my team, they might not highly interested in participating the activities and not willing to discuss the idea with us. Although there are some potential challenges I might face during the course, I will think a way to solve it such as explain my idea clearly to each team members in order to break the language barrier and show more consideration to the uncooperative members.

The primary skill i hope to the ability to notice an opportunity and generate ideas that are of value to a business allowing it to grow, more specifically understanding the mindset of those who have produced innovative ideas in the past but also the valuable skill of being able to look to the future and how things can be amended or changed and ultimately improved (thinking outside the box).

Secondly the ability to interact in a professional manner especially with stakeholders that are older and have authority within the business. I feel as if this is something that i have been exposed to previously but i would like to fine the my skills in ensuring that all stakeholders take me seriously irrespective of the age difference between us.

What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?

From previous work experience as mentioned above i am responsible for making presentations to stakeholders and believe my skills in portraying an idea in its best light are quite extensive, furthermore i am also very analytical and in specific elements of the project where data needs to be gathered and interpreted i feel i would be well suited to the challenge.

Lastly having worked as part of  strategic team in a large organisation the skills involved with being part of a team such as communication, leadership and listening are also advanced.

Before applying for the challenge, the 'innovation' aspect is what scared me the most - it was a skill that I wasn't required to particularly use at university or in my working life. However, innovation is a skill that is employers are now particularly looking for in employees, and a skill I'm hoping to develop over the course of this experience. I can already see how I'm developing this skill through thinking of ideas for 'Idea Zone' and offering feedback on others' ideas. I've begun to think 'outside the box' and look at ideas in a different light - both skills that I've only developed in the course of a week. Apart from innovation, I'm hoping to develop my networking skills - I'm a very outgoing person but I feel like the word 'networking' makes me anxious and nervous. I definitely think that working with such a wide variety of people of different levels will help me be more at ease and allow me to develop networking skills that will be beneficial in my career. 

My strongest skill, I believe, is communication and working in a team. I enjoy working with people and interacting with people, and I think I'm able to put forward ideas and critiques in a way that is friendly and constructive. However, I definitely that being a part of a challenge that is so fast paced will help further develop these skills and build new skills that are associated with working within a team. I also think I've got strong time management and organisational skills that I've developed through juggling full-time work, internships and university.

It has constantly been an issue for me since the HSC and until the last two years I have been disappointed by the results I have gotten and decisions I have made. Maturity has definitely helped and my last two years have been more productive. As a result I successfully took on additional responsibilities at work and have been rewarded for strong academia. I still have a tendency to leave my work to the last minute and it is something which I'm very open with each group that I work with. While I know that I maintain a high quality standard of output and have always been reliable, there is no doubt that planning my work and having time to review it will have benefits for myself and the team. One benefit though of being a last minute worker is that it takes a long time for stress to get to me and I'm able to work calmly, and also keep my team calm and productive if the project experiences any difficulties. Furthermore I also have a tendency to volunteer to take on more work then I can handle. Hence another skill I'd like to be able to develop is managing people and ensuring equal contribution to output. 

Over the last two years I have been privileged to have have been involved in two projects which will be greatly beneficial to Deloitte Fastrack. The first was last year, representing Macquarie in a global synthetic biology competition called iGEM. As a team of 12 we were the first Australian university to achieve a gold medal. This was an incredibly complex project not only scientifically, but also involved marketing, fundraising, community outreach and research. There were numerous practical and internal challenges and mixed expertise in the group. however I have been able to witness what overcoming these problems can achieve if the group works together and applied their individual competencies. 

The second experience I was a part of was less a pleasant experience. In a team of 4 doing volunteer work for the university, one person dominated the group through by over controlling the way the group worked. They were openly dissatisfied if even the majority disagreed with their view point and were very pushy in ensuring the use of processes which did not fully apply to the work being done. As a result the team was very hesitant to contribute openly. It also resulted in me having to do a lot of reworking at the last minute at the request of the staff supervisors which was detrimental to not only myself but the team. After going through the current learning material, it is a small worry to me that some members of the team may decide to become too reliant on set methodology and frameworks. However having gone through the recent experience I'm sure I'll be able to handle the situation much better.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

It will be an insightful journey for my future. The Deloitte Fastrack program is important to me, as it will allow me to understand the different market opportunities that businesses target and how an idea can grow further with research and development. 

I am hoping to improve my communication and interaction skills that are needed in a professional workplace environment. These are important skills that I will need at some point in my life and to have that opportunity to work on it will be a good stepping-stone. With the opportunity to be in the Deloitte Fastrack program, I will be able to achieve my goals as not only this is an amazing opportunity but also I will be working with professionals to develop my idea with the group further.

The main skills that I have acquired from University and work experience are leadership skills and entrepreneurial skills. With these skills, I will be able to contribute new ideas in the project as with past experiences I have work in a team to innovate new ideas for the Entrepreneurship Competitions. Improving efficiency is important when innovating, as you would want processes to be more cost effective in order to improve shareholders value. The entrepreneurial skills that I have gain thought me how to differentiate businesses products from its competitors. In order to be successful, employees need to have a creative mindset, which will allow the product to differentiate the business from its competitors. Having leadership skills is important, as it will allow me to make sure that everything is done on time by making the extra initiative to see if everyone is on the right track. These skills will allow me to take on responsibilities to ensure that tasks are done on time in order not to disappoint the stakeholders that will be helping each group out. By adding responsibility on myself, it will allow me to work better to improve the current skills that I have. 

Potential challenges that might arise are that all team members might have a different idea and they might not specifically agree with the idea that I have. This might cause disagreements in the team as team members might think that a particular person is favouring an idea over theirs. It will allow me to learn that corporation within a team is important and everyone should respect each other. When everyone respects each other decision on why the outcome was made the potential conflict can be avoided. As Deloitte is a big company, potential challenges will tend to arise in a fast working paced environment. As employees of Deloitte, learning how to adapt to a change in situation is an important skill, as employees have to be ready for the change whenever they are working on a problem. This might arise as a challenge to the Fastrack challenge as not everyone ideas will get selected and being able to change your idea around to fit the other teammates ideas is important.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I’ve always been a “follower” in that I prefer taking instructions to giving them. I don’t like being in charge and tend to avoid roles that require me to be responsible for other’s actions. However I do want to become a leader and to develop confidence in myself as an individual and as a team member in this project and to allow myself to step out and take the lead when necessary. I hope to develop confidence in speaking and in presenting. I often struggle with this even though I’ve had to do many team presentations for university. I don’t think I’ve ever been able to develop this skill which I know is essential for any future role I may take on. Through practicing and putting myself out there throughout this experience, I’m confident that I will develop this skill. I hope to expand on my people skills and learn to demonstrate interpersonal skills. Whilst I feel confident that I am a good communicator, I hope this experience, through developing my professional engagement and communication skills, helps to learn to communicate effectively in any and all situations that I find myself if throughout this experience, be that with my team or with industry professionals in a professional environment. I know this skill will be key in any workplace I find myself in the future and I want to be sure that I develop it throughout this experience. 

I also want to learn analytical skills and how to conduct market research and analysis, which I believe, are skills increasingly becoming important for the workplace but also skills specific to this program. The development of our innovation as a team will require these skills and I’m eager to put them to practice. I also hope to learn how to effectively work in a team, how to calmly handle surprises, how to remain a patient and understanding team member and how to stay calm under pressure.  But I also want to learn how to be a co-worker that will encourage other members to step out of their comfort zones and try new things. This is what I would expect from any co-workers and this is what I hope to be able to be within my team for this program. 

My current part time job is at Macquarie University’s Campus Wellbeing Disability Service and one of my responsibilities is attending the classes of disabled or terminally ill students and taking notes and summaries of each weeks topic. This experience has made me a careful listener and extremely attentive to detail and I think these skills will be vital for this program. I believe that I have strong time management skills and a goal oriented focus which I can offer to my team throughout this experience. I am a goal setting and do my best to be an achiever: I set out projects and tasks and plan how long each task will take. Throughout all my team projects and assignments both university and non-university related, I like to help take charge of the organisation of the project. I can offer a proactive and focused approach to this project. Along with time management I can contribute organisation skills. I like to be in control of my workload at all times. my diary is always planned out even from the beginning of the semester and I add to it as I go but additionally, I feel confident that I am flexible and able to handle change well. Throughout my entire degree so far, I have juggled university work with a part-time job as well as volunteering, time with my family and time with friends. I think I’ve come to understand that some things do have to give when I’m busy and that doesn’t make me a bad person. It makes me a focused student/worker who understand priorities and with a great work ethic.

-       What skills are you hoping to develop over the course of this experience?
I’m hoping to develop solid ideation/critical thinking skills in terms of the sectors relevant to Deloitte. I consider myself creative and have always had multiple ideas when brainstorming in the past but topics such as auditing are daunting to me. I hope with research I’ll be more knowledgeable and will be able to efficiently ideate and make valuable contributions. 
I’m also looking to increase my business/industry relevant skills by becoming adept at utilising the lean innovation cycle and its aspects eg. the business model canvas, agile development etc. 
-       What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?
I previously participated in the Serious Games and Simulations program which is run in the same manner as the Deloitte Fastrack program. I therefore have an idea of how to make the most out of the experience. My team won and we were lucky enough to all live close to each other so we could meet up often and put in the effort to develop our idea. This is definitely what I believe led to our success. I’m also prepared and equipped for the ambiguous business environment. previously there was a lot of differing communication and assessment requirements would change suddenly. From this experience I know that my team and I need to be highly adaptable in order to navigate this environment effectively. 
-       What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?
I think a potential challenge will be clashes amongst team members. It is likely that everyone won’t see eye to eye throughout the process but it will give myself and the team the opportunity to further enhance negotiation skills and the ability to work in diverse teams which is going to happen when in the workforce.
Another foreseeable challenge may occur as we develop our idea. Although we’re meant to take a ‘lean’ approach it may be disheartening to put effort into researching etc and then instead of moving to the iteration phase and making improvements to the same idea having to pivot and try again if our idea isn’t well supported after we conduct research. There is great potential for learning if this does occur as we will get more efficient moving through the cycle and eventually find the idea that does work.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Communication and writing are pivotal to any business to achieve goals and be successful. In turn I hold communication as my key strength as I enjoy the social aspect of working as a team and seeing a project being accomplished. However these skills have been limited in application due to my lack of practical experience in a business environment. Additionally my writing skills have been neglected at times and hopefully through assistance of this program I am able learn more about writing properly and communicating in a professional setting so that I can provide valuable contributions to my group and progress far through this competition.

As indicated in the previous paragraph I hold communication as one of my strengths regarding my skillset. I heavily enjoy working with others and achieving goals whereby our time and effort was rewarded. My university projects as well as my jobs have illustrated my effectiveness in terms of connecting with members and facilitating an open environment whereby individuals are able to communicate freely. Hopefully I am able to bring forward a sense of inspiration and cohesion to my group so that we can meet the requirements of Delloite and make our mark in this challenge. 

Another skill I bring to this project is my excellent organisational and research skills. Throughout my degree and various group projects I often had to search thoroughly through various sources to find information relevant to a group assignment. As a result I firmly believe that I can showcase these skills effectively to ensure our product is researched properly and continue to advance through the duration of this course. Additionally I can be seen as a perfectionist at times, which relates to my organisational capabilities. My roles in my previous group assignments at university have often been allocating tasks and facilitating meetings with members. I aim to carry on this experience to this project so that my group can make a product that is revolutionary in the most efficient way possible.

I wish to practice my communication skills so that I will be able to present my ideas fluently and confidently. I wish I would be able to speak like a native speaker. 

I have learnt fundamental business subjects in the university, and later on specialised in Accounting industry. I wish to bring in my knowledge to create ideas. I have been participated in group projects before and I believe I am a diplomatic person. I wish I would be able to resolve problems and minimise conflicts so that my team will be able to reach a common goal without major resentments towards each other. 

I think the potential challenges is finding the specific solution from diverse options. There are no boundaries to ideas. Therefore, the challenge is to find the relevant and useful concept without diverting too much from the common goal.

Thirdly i'd love to actually work on solving a problem and providing a solution that actually comes into fruition.

The skills and experiences I believe I am able to contribute to the project is that I am a team player, obey deadlines, work quiet well in a leadership role (having had many years experience) and am able to communicate/present very well. 

I believe the potential challenges that our team could face in the initial screening process is that some individuals may get caught up in the little details which will effect the 'big picture' and ultimately the creation of the rest of the idea.

Two of the main skills I would like to build upon are my interpersonal skills as well as my critical analysis skills. Interacting with others in an effective manner, and attempting to work towards a common solution would be very rewarding experience that I could definitely learn from. This would include working with others who I would not normally work with in these situations. Drawing upon the strengths of each individual member of the team as well as of the assigned Mentor and implementing them to come up with the best possible solution would be extremely beneficial on a personal level because this means that I have effectively collaborated with other individuals. In the future when I reflect back on this period, I can realise and extrapolate the fundamental achievements that allowed this experience to work out. Critical analysis is also another concept that I wish to improve on. The FASTRACK challenge will be a learning curve for me, as this would be the first time I am exposed to a professional services workplace. The unfamiliarity of this environment would bring about its own challenges however, such as ambiguity and certain phases of being overwhelmed from being exposed to large amounts of information.  As I take in all of this information that has been presented to me thus far, it has become apparent the need to be selective in what is relatively important to my personal learning and development. This course will allow me to hone this skill as I work through large magnitudes of data and extrapolate key ideas and concepts, which can definitely be beneficial for me later in life. 

I strongly believe that I can have a positive influence on this course and my team by exercising my leadership skills that I have developed from numerous past experiences. I have participated in, and continue to participate in a wide array of extra curricular activities that I believe may be of particular use during this program. In particular my current role as Department Leader of Treasury at ECFS will be of use because it has encouraged me to keep the team focused and motivated throughout processes. This can be particularly important because, especially during large-scale projects, team members may drift from the main task at hand, which leads to inefficiency and deadlines not being met. A true leader can manage the team, as well as work effectively within one to get any given task done, and I believe I have extensive experience regarding that matter.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I usually came the coffee shops and restaurants to persuade their owner and managers switching off unnecessary light and electrical equipment during Earth Hour. It was harder work than i though. At that time, 2011, there are not too many people know about this campaign so I usually considered how i can convince them and make them trust me. Communication skill is the best skill i learned from that. How was the root of this issue? Why did the coffee managers ignore my campaign? Firstly, they did not know about the Earth Hour (How, What, Why, When, Where - answer all question as basic skill). Secondly, What can they get after joining this campaign? Although, It is a social campaign, everyone usually considers the benefits (improve reputation, have more customers...).

-I have leaded small team groups up to 6 members.
-During my work as a financial auditor, I had the opportunity to learn about the reality of different sectors in Peru (especially retail and mining), what problems they face and what they looking for.
-I was part of a team to suggest and apply innovated ideas with the aim to improve the actual work environment and looking for efficiency in EY - Peru. Efficiency was understood as alleviate the high amount of work and avoid irrelevant work.

First, I really want to adapt to the virtual learning environment. ""The world is flat"" is being true in many aspects of life. Communication technology is greatly changing the way people work enabling us to work and study on the go with any connected device. This program is a great example of this movement, offering a virtual platform to work with. Till the end of this, learners may be more familiar with distant learning and working. In addition, I also enjoy the atmosphere this program may bring. Since people signed up for it, meaning they actually want to do the project, not just passing the regular exams. A like-minded team is likely to be fun and productive. Cultural diversity is something I want to experience in this course.
    I had a background in public accounting and auditing sector. Working as team to solve client's issues was my everyday business. There was no fixed team as we have dynamic roster for each job. Constant change of teammates was the norm in the industry, therefore, I would have no issue working in team, no matter how it is formed. Thanks to the previous professional job, the ability to read and understand financial reports is one of my strength that I learnt.
   One challenge that is foreseeable in distant workplace is the disengagement of team members. Emails may be sent, read, and forgotten, thus, a way to communicate to all team members is crucial. Another thing that may jeopardise the group work is possibly the lack of physical meeting. If it's something we can postponed to the weekend, it's likely that it's delayed further to the following week because students are not required to meet every week. However, I do hope to see some enthusiasm in the class because we enrolled for our own interest.

I used to do a lot of projects that involved teamwork in my home university but we never work for real clients. I guess compared to school projects, the course will give me a more complete view on a project in the real world context. It will require that I do not only rely on instructions but that I think critically and out of the box. I guess that I am hoping that I would be able to develop my creative thinking as well as my presentation skills in a professional context. Above all, I hope it will give more confidence of my capabilities to find relevant solutions for a real company problematic. It will help in the future in the way that I could fell more confortable with set out my skills and my ideas to future employers. Furthermore, I have never done a project/course within the context of Asia. I am sure that I will gain knowledge about Asian culture and economy, which can be very helpful for my own general culture and for my professional career. 

What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?
I have already experienced several team projects. Therefore I have learned a lot about teamwork coordination and adaptation to different way of working from different individuals, different cultures. Even if it is not my favourite way of working, I conducted a project from Lille with others team members located in Paris, working through online open spaces and Skype meeting. At my home university, I have done a lot of presentations and attended a seminar on communication skills.  I have a background of bachelor in general business which can be helpful for an overview of the situation but I am also specializing in marketing so I hope I have enough knowledge to give deep answers/solutions that are marketing related. 

What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?
From past experiences, I know that teamwork can be challenging if team members do not get along in a professional way.  I personally think that the output of teamwork has an important value compared to individual works, as it is the results of a mix of different thinking, different personalities, and different cultures. Nevertheless, in some cases it can also be very time consuming. In order to cope with this challenge, I guess the team will need to really involve and engage themselves in the work, be assertive about their ideas but also open to new options, to have in mind their personal goal but also the goal of the team (if aligned it is even better!) and more importantly a very efficient communication between members. Even if I have already work in team, I think each team is different and I can always learn more about teamwork with new teams and new experiences. 
The other challenge that I see is time management. Additionally of this course, I am following three other units, I am writing a thesis and will potentially have a part-time job. I am also an exchange student so I would like to visit Australia as I have the chance to be in this country only for 6 months. I am usually a stressed person and I tend to work at a slower pace than my co-workers so I guess it is for me the scariest challenge. I will need to be organized in order to avoid being overwhelmed. From this challenge, I hope I will gain confidence and have a better stress management.

So I'd like to engage in this project that would be a fantastic experience to capitalize on the new training method.

I hope it would be helpful for me to commit to this project.

I am also hoping to gain skills in client engagement and understanding the process behind developing and implementing business ideas.

As a result of the EY Asian Century program, I am hoping to develop practical skills within the fields of consulting and advisory. More specifically, I am hoping to develop greater data analytical skills and skills surrounding design thinking. After exploring the E&Y website and looking over the expansive business fields this program covers, such as economics, finance, accountancy, management and data, I feel that I may not have the same statistical and data orientated skills analyise skills that an accountancy and finance student might have. Also, whilst the modules on Design Thinking are straightforward and logical, this perspective on innovation is new to me. I have had experiences with complex problem Strategising for innovation, but this new context of design thinking for innovation is new. As such, I want to develop these data analytical skills and design thinking skills to develop my abilities in complex problem solving and innovation and data analysis in professional projects and team situations. 

Before starting this program however, I believe I bring a unique array of skills and abilities as a result of my career to-date, education and co-curricular experiences. My background in education provides me with skills in project planning and development. I have direct experience in initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and closing projects for a magnitude of clients. Furthermore, I believe I can bring interpersonal communication and collaborative skills to the team due to my experience in education and involvement in co-curricular programs such as coaching of debating and track and field. I have been involved in a myriad of collaborative teams and environments that have taught me about leadership and provided me with experiences to build upon. This will aid in the planning and design of course project, working and communicating effectively in teams and reflecting practices on performance. 

Differently, there are challenges I foresee that the team will face in the participation of this program. The metrics of this program allow for great diverse outcomes, however, diverse collaborative environments can present interpersonal difficulties. Firstly, due to having vast and varying personalities, it is my experience that there can be issues relating to flexibility in collaborative environments. Secondly, as commonly found in educational settings, group projects can leave some people worried about the amount of contribution from all members. Lastly, in creative and innovative settings, people can be sensitive over criticism of their ideas, as well as people can over complicate or think contexts. Therefore, due to the collaborative environment, we need to be aware of differences, people’s feelings and do out best to contribute to the best of our abilities in the modes we can contribute the most. 

I look forward to any and all upcoming challenges and developing my professional knowledge through this experiential learning.

With analysis I hope to cover the gathering and interpretation of raw numbers to understand whether a particular idea or hypothesis will stack up commercially.  With structuring I hope to learn from EY how they structure proposals, that is how they present options, what things to focus on, etc.  With presenting I hope to learn how to be persuasive in putting forward a proposal, and ensure that I articulate myself well.

In terms of skills and experience, I have 5 years experience as an Analyst, Project Manager and Senior Analyst in Australia's largest ICT company, Telstra.  A large part of the role at Telstra is developing business cases for new proposals.  As such I am very confident undertaking research, generating the costs and benefits of a project, and performing investment evaluation techniques using Discounted Cash Flow (resulting in Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, Payback Period).  I also am in the process of launching my own startup online business palmeraapparel.com.au,  selling apparel such as T-Shirts, Wallets, Watches.  During the process I have learnt how to quickly set up an idea with website hosts such as Shopify, source suppliers through Alibaba, undertake pricing and profitability analysis, and learn about marketing particularly through the social media channel. 

Potential challenge wise, is the ""working in a team"" component of this exercise, where this is no defined lead of the project.  The argument from Universities has always been that in the real world we'll be working in teams, so we should be doing that as part of our assessment.  The issue I have with this is that in the real world, there is a project manager, or a project lead, who sets the work activities that people need to meet.  In this University environment, there is not one set ""lead"", which can lead to people fighting over trying to take pole position and the associated arguments.  If there is no lead and everything is on a purely democratic basis, I also find this rarely works well.  In terms of overcoming this challenge, I don't yet have an answer and it will depend on how this course is structured.

I also am very comfortable with my working style and am confident of my ability to fit into and work with the TV/EY team and am very much looking forward to this experience!

Challenges: I imagine that I will be exposed to new ways of thinking around approaches to solving problems that exist within different countries that I may not have been directly exposed to before.
Also, decision making with respect to the team environment could be challenging in that team members will bring different approaches that will need to be coordinated to sell the most effective decision to the client.
Another challenge will be to gain an understanding of the way business is done and how this works best from TV/EY point of view for the client.
In addition, I imagine that I will need to learn very quickly and in great detail the nature of Asia, its business, economic, social and cultural aspects to understand the solutions we need to deliver for the client.

- Asking questions - Asking intelligent questions to the EY mentors that use the correct language and are relevant to the problem at hand
- Observing different team environments and organisational culture - Reviewing how EY work in solving problems, organisational culture and systems and processes relevant to their businesses - so I can reflect and reiterate my own systems, processes and cultural understandings about an effective work environment (the syllabus originally said that a work placement every Friday was part of the course so this was my main interest)

I am very well rounded from professional report writing and presentation to detailed advanced Excel and analysis skills.

 I have conducted high level business presentations (to executives at MIRVAC and Woolworths and Local Government Mayors and Councillors in various previous roles - I am a little older than most students at 30 so have about 8 years previous experience).

I have also been asked to write detailed write final draft professionally edited documents and reports. 

My analytical skills are also second to none. I have advanced Excel skills and have a high mathematical proficiency. 

I have also worked with various other groups and provide working drafts always on-time (I have a high work ethic and expect the same).

I am looking to join a team of other like minded professionals with some previous work experience as I want to collaborate with other highly driven individuals that want to make the most from this elective.

Also, to communicate with people that (as myself) do not have english as first language will be good for me, since I will have to be more precise when I explain my ideas. I can sometimes get a bit carried away when I find something interesting and I have realized that due to language barriers it can cause misunderstanding, so that is something I will work on.

I have very limited professional experience engaging with the business world and I see the forthcoming interactions, with Viji Venkat, her colleagues and the QUT staff and fellow students, as being one of the best chances to get more comfortable interacting with true business professionals. This environment will also provide another opportunity to work as part of a team which has been beneficial every time, for different but ultimately positive reasons. I always look forward to meeting a new group of people who will be driven towards a common goal. Group work presents its own set of unique challenges, but I believe that the more groups one gets involved in then the better they will engage in the next group-centric situation. Finally I would like to improve my skill of opportunity execution - in that when I am provided with an opportunity and I have a potential solution, I want to execute that solution to its fullest extent as soon as possible. I have found that I can 'lag' in taking action towards opportunities which have presented themselves, only to act once the opportunity has passed. I am working on this already, but I am hoping this experience can set my conviction in stone. 
My own experiences tend to stem from casual sales, marketing and hospitality roles in various organisations. I also have prior event  management experience in an eight month appointment with International House College. Given the blend of roles, I have a blend of skills to accompany them. Primarily I excel at communication and relationship development with customers and businesses, engaging with them to procure deals which help both parties. This stems from being employed in very different workplaces (for example, consider a nightclub to a jewellery store) and learning to talk to many different types of people in varying contexts. Another skill I believe I could bring to the table here would be identifying opportunities. Often for me this is by blending complementary attributes of two or more companies, or industries, to create something which would be the next step forward for both entities. While this is not a large list of skills, I believe I am adaptive and can slot into any role that best uses my talents or that the team would require of me.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I believe during these past few years studying, I have been constantly working with other people from different backgrounds, which has helped me to improve my communication skills and develop the ability to come up with ideas on my own by using logical reasoning to solve case studies. Furthermore, having lived in China for nearly two years, travelled extensively in South East Asia, and studied the Asian cultures helped me to gain an in-depth understanding the importance of their cultural values and the impact it has when negotiating across borders.

Even though they are not my team members anymore, I still remember the experience disappointed me. When I shared my thoughts with people, they nodded and seemed to agree with me. However, when they summarised the ideas of everyone, my idea wasn't on the list. I feel disappointed at myself because my knowledge and ideas are not logical and impressive for others. Thus, firstly, I hope I could make improvement of defining and prototyping skills. Secondary, I hope that I could build up my creative ideas into a rationale structure and give a clear statement to show other team members what my POV is. Thirdly, I hope I could learn how to build another people's idea in terms of the promotion and development of this learning journey. On the other hand, I have social skills such as a consultant and basic financial background. I am keen to engage with people and understand what people need and desire.

I look forward to learning and applying design thinking into the tasks assigned during the duration of the course. I’ll acquire a range of business skills such as working in a professional team, project management, critical thinking, problem solving and pitching in variety of methods which will be required to be a part of a well performing team. I’ll have an opportunity to conduct a business analysis and apply the findings to propose a new business strategy. I’ll learn the skill to identify new Asian market opportunities and growth strategies for EY, Tiger Ventures and its clients.  I hope to earn the skill of communicating well with stakeholders as well as team members. Last but not the least, I’d gain a relevant work experience which would be a highlight to my resume.

2) Over the period of my degree which I started 1.5 years ago, I did numerous group assignments. I have always been a part of supportive, motivating and well performing teams. Each one of us used to motivate and support one another in doing tasks. I have noticed that I have performed really well when I was a part of such kind of a team. 
For one of units called Business in Australia, we had to do a business report for an Australian company called “Dymocks”, based on its industry, structure, culture etc in Australia and then post our recommendations for the challenges it’s currently facing in Australia. 
 I remember doing an assignment for a unit called “Marketing Internationally”, where we had to launch a product of an Australian company in one of the two countries viz Japan or Germany, after doing the SWOT and CAGE analysis of these countries. We also had to identify the best market entry strategy for the chosen country. During the process of doing this assignment I kept researching on various websites and databases to identify the growth opportunities in these countries. This assignment helped me gain the skill of researching extensively as well as to identify a business strategy for the company. 
Thus having the experience of doing  these two assignments, I feel confident about carrying out an extensive research about an Industry, country, company and its culture as well pitching in variety of strategies/methods. 
I did another assignment for a unit called “Equity Trading Floor”. It was a long assignment which had no word limit and we had to do a reflective writing 2-3 times a week every time we did a trade. I ended up doing a 12,000 word assignment and I used to write about 2000 words of trades every week along with juggling with other uni assignments and work. In the end I was proud of myself for managing my time effectively. 


What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?

Conflicts within the team when all team members do not agree on some points may arise. I can also once again learn to manage time effectively between this course and other university courses. Also the process of project learning methodology can be challenging since this is new for me. I also feel finding an opportunity based on the conducted business analysis can be a bit challenging. I look forward to learn from these challenges which might arise.

The skills and experiences that I bring to his project, both personal strengthens and professional experience, has been developed in my undergraduate degree and professional experience as a Town Planner.  These personal strengthens have been further highlighted in the Briggs Myers personality test. The strengths which allow me to feel confident in participating group situations include task orientated, organised and effective time management.  From my professional experience I understand private consulting industry (although from a different discipline), both achieving and managing client expectations, and the importance of being able to deliver technical information to wide audience.

Initially when I enrolled I hoped to further improve my professional business skills, understanding of Asian markets and the business operations of a multinational like EY. After viewing the introduction material I soon realised an area that had been underdeveloped in my education is a creative way of thinking. I consider creative thinking one of the most important and most exciting skills to develop as part of this project 

Developing my creative thinking and formulation of ideas will be a challenge which I will find most rewarding when conquered. This skill will provide me with a new methodology and confidence to approach future challenges. 

Reflecting on my thoughts and feelings at the beginning of this process has allowed me to be more readied for the challenges to follow.  Acknowledging my goals, strengths and potential challenges as detailed above will allow me to be more readied for meaningful and productive interaction in a group situation.

Deloitte Fastrack Innovation Challenge 2015,QUT BSB305,BSB305 - QUT 2015s1 FASTRACK,2015-02-22,participant,Michaela Connors, 8596603,michaela.connors@student.qut.edu.au,BSB305 Team 1,2015-04-22 12:18:37,2015-03-08 05:45:06,Student Reflection 1,submitted,2015-03-12 05:51:57,Write your reflection blog here,"Critically reflecting on a learning experience is an important process that allows increased control and awareness, providing greater meaning and self-understanding (Henrick, 2004). This permits reflection on learning that measurably step changes the performance and extraction of value throughout the experience. Investigation into my current learning has allowed a clearer understanding of how my skillset was developed, and the areas that I aim to develop. 

Over the duration of the experience I aim to develop industry specific skills that can only be practiced within a real world business context. Study at University has provided a strong foundation of theoretical knowledge, and I now aspire to bridge the gap through experiential learning into real world practice and experience. Risk taking through active experimentation is a skill that I have had minimal opportunity to explore, due to structured assessment. I believe it is important to take risks in order to meet new demands, challenge the status quo, and keep up with constant shifts and emerging markets. The ability to help an organisation take calculated risks and become a catalyst for growth is a valuable skill to be learnt. 

Developing a belief in my abilities when presented with various situations will play a fundamental role in how I approach future goals, tasks and challenges. As resources are provided for this experience, I hope this will allow development of self-efficacy when applying my abilities to produce constructive outcomes (Locke & Latham, 2002). The development of select skills will assist my capabilities, provide preparation and allow continued implementation throughout my future as an emerging professional. 

The combination of my degrees has allowed the development of a diverse skillset, combing creative experimentation with business strategy. Currently studying a Bachelor of Business/Bachelor of Creative Industries has allowed practice and application of key skills, including design thinking and creative strategy to assorted case studies. As I have had the opportunity to apply theoretical design strategies to business problems, I have a unique skill to reframe problems, see beyond what is and leverage creativity with exploration. This skillset will be beneficial within a multidisciplinary team, as innovation stems from a creative outlook to help differentiate from others. 

I have had the opportunity to apply this skillset across a multitude of projects with YMCA Brisbane and Red Cross, and more recently in an internship. Each of these experiences involved the creation of a different strategy, where I learnt to apply a creative approach into a structured document or framework. Due to their success, these experiences have built upon my confidence for future application within new contexts. I plan to show my team the benefits of thinking differently by design and how it can be leveraged as a tool to encourage innovation. 

The greatest challenge I believe will arise over the course of this experience, is my ability to effectively manage time between both internal project tasks and external commitments. This is due to an internship and casual employment that I undertake, alongside full time study. Effectively managing time between a varied team of stakeholders with different levels of commitment may arise. Working under time constraints and pressures is a common practice in the workplace, which I plan to develop through the experiential learning embedded in this experience. 

Theoretical learning at University and experience in projects has allowed self-awareness in where my strengths lie. My current skillset that comprises of an ability to apply design thinking and creative solutions to business strategy, is an area I aim to contribute to this project. However the skills I aim to develop throughout this experience is my ability to take calculated risks and develop self-efficacy.

An established industry leading firm like Deloitte, setting guidelines to make sure they are acquiring new innovation from outside sources is something I immediately bought in to. This symbiotic relationship is something that can create value for Deloitte and myself as a young professional. The kinds of skills I think it can develop revolve around my ability to develop an idea. Looking at the Lean Innovation model that was presented in the first module I believe I can gain the skills required to take my ideas in the first stage and carry them through to agile development. Taking ideas and learning to create real value is something that I can only learn in a theoretical context at university. The ability to actually take innovation through the full cycle with the help of Deloitte will be invaluable in my development.
I hope to bring a strong analytical and critical thinking ability complemented by my interpersonal skills to this program. I like to think that there is no such thing as a bad idea and I thrive in an environment where I can develop ideas with peers and bounce ideas around in a discussion. I tend to take a global view to issues and this is the same when I think of innovation I tend to think global. I am a person with a strong social conscience and am driven by the prospect of finding ways for entrepreneurship to change the world for the better. This program has a strong focus on intraprenuership something that I hope that in the future I can use to build a better world for all. One particular pieces of innovation that particularly interests me is the rise of micro-finance in third world countries. With all my ambition I hope I will look back on this fastrack program and realise the significant improvement I have gained in my ability to create value, to work in large organisations and effectively communicate my ideas.

Having completed group assignments throughout my university career prior to this subject, I bring with me knowledge of my strengths and weaknesses within a group environment. I know that I find it difficult to raise issues or concerns with team members as I'm someone who naturally avoids any form of conflict. Going into BSB305 aware of this particular weakness gives me the opportunity to actively practice interpersonal skills that assist with conflict resolution. Through studying emotional intelligence (EI) in BSB124 and taking numerous EI tests, I am aware that I have high emotional intelligence. I do find that I usually accurately perceive the emotions of others and respond to them in ways that foster positive relationships, and this will assist me to help develop a good group energy. 
BSB305 does not have regular classes each week which will have various implications for myself. Although I have strong time management that has been developed through balancing full-time study, part-time work and commitments to volunteering and sport, I do sometimes struggle to motivate myself. I find that a class environment often helps me to renew my drive to complete assigned tasks, so this unit will put me in a position where I will have to find another way of staying motivated.

A personal goal that I have been working towards for a number of years is managing my anxiety towards public speaking. By being further exposed to speaking publicly at the end of the unit I can work towards increase my competency, which is important as being able to speak publicly is a strong asset to have as a graduate. 
Having just completed QUTs Business Advantage workshop for Entrepreneurship I will be able to contribute what I learned from Jeremy Hayllar who is an senior executive at BDO.

I can take what I have learned in other courses at QUT and apply it to real world problems to take my skill set to the next level and develop further as a professional. I am looking forward to  gaining an understanding of how consulting works within a global firm.

The biggest skill set I have which will allow me to positively contribute to the team is my professional communication skills.

Over my past three years at university I have developed my interpersonal skills by working in teams from both disciplines of my double degree (Business/Creative Industries). However, these teams have always been for the purpose of assessment items. As Fastrack is an experiential learning program with work integrated elements I believe there is potential to further develop my interpersonal skills in a different and real world context. Similarly, I’m hoping that Fastrack will further highlight specific strengths and weaknesses in relation to my intrapersonal effectiveness, which I can use to focus my professional development. 

From my work experience within a large international company I have learnt to view issues from a broader corporate perspective. This outlook coupled with an entrepreneurial mind by nature, positions me well to problem solve tasks through applying intrapreneurial methods.

Fastrack presents many potential challenges on both individual and group levels. Working within a team always brings with it specific challenges to achieve a successful common goal. As opposed to university, where a student completes progressive assessment items throughout the semester, Fastrack involves managing a long-term project. This could be a potential challenge because I expect it will be a more tedious process of failing, reviewing, changing and so forth, but will also be very insightful into navigating the business environment.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I also want to develop my innovation skills, and to learn to identify key areas of potential growth and development. Through this personal development in innovation, I believe both my entrepreneurship and intrepreneurship mentality will be improved. Whilst I believe that being entrepreneurial has much to do with an individuals mindset, I also believe that by improving the skills associated with being entrepreneurial, one can further develop that mindset. I believe that one of my skills which will help me in this project is my ability to identify potential weaknesses in ideas.  This constructive criticism approach assists in identifying potential problems with new ideas in their early development. This in turn will create a better overall project as they will be developed with all pitfalls in mind.

Coming into this Fastrack challenge I have only very limited innovation experience from my IT subjects such as IFB101 impact of IT and IFB103 Designing for IT.

I believe this subject can provide me with the knowledge of socially responsible behaviour when addressing and evaluating business issues in both national and international contexts. I hope to build stronger written and oral skills for presentations whilst being able to facilitate differing audiences with a confidence to defend ideas.

Living independently while studying and working part-time has allowed me to develop sound time management skills. It has also allowed me to develop teamwork skills, whilst still being able to work autonomously. 3 years of tertiary education has provided me with the frameworks needed for a professional industry. I am observant and show strong attention to detail. I believe I am able to maintain a level head and can manage conflict resolution in a calm manner.

Some potential challenges that may arise over the semester are as follows. Matching the team’s schedules for collaboration, which may conclude in using other modes of communication. Difference in opinion’s about the project with team members or the client. Providing work that is of a higher standard. Accessing all necessary information for the project.

These include becoming a more effective presenter. being able to more efficiently analyse an issue. and be more confident that my recommendations will contribute value to my client's goals. 

I especially want to improve my understanding of innovation, its importance in idea generation, and how it applies to creating a business model and value proposition. 

I already feel that I am a natural presenter and am confident in public speaking. I am a creative person and have a passion for design. These elements assist me in creating, what I believe, are engaging presentation decks that convey an outcome clearly and persuasively. 

I am also someone who enjoys having a full plate of obligations and is always busy. This forces me to manage my time effectively. So I will bring to the project a strong work ethic and an appreciation of meeting deadlines and milestones. 

I tend to assume leadership positions where no position is delegated. This may pose a challenge that I will have to overcome when working in a team of likeminded students. I will need to mitigate this tendency by being more open minded and recognising the value derived from collaboration and constructive commentary. I believe there is a time and place for strong leadership. I believe that being able to manage a team and ensure that commitment to the goals and deliverables for a larger task is a necessity. However, I will learn and develop better team-working skills by engaging in other working styles and team norms. 

Being placed outside of my comfortable working style and forcing myself to adapt and learn from different perspectives will be very rewarding.

Over the length of my degree, I have completed a number of work placements but I don't feel as though I got any hands on experience working as part of a team to develop something worthwhile. Additionally, I have always struggled with public speaking which I put down to a lack of self confidence.

It will be a benefit to me to work with mentors and colleagues as part of a team and get some hands on experience in a large corporate setting, pitching to executives. This will be a great challenge that I am determined to overcome in order to develop these skills.

 As a consequence of growing up overseas and doing a lot of travelling, including attending a seminar sponsored by the QUT business school in Cambodia and an exchange semester, I have exceptional teamwork skills. Additionally, I have worked in the hospitality industry for almost a decade delegating roles and tasks. These experiences have given me organisational, team work and empathy skills.

I would also like to further develop my presentation skills. Having the ability to present well and sell is essential in a workplace no matter if it’s to colleagues or clients.

I believe I will have the opportunity to develop this skill through working in a team to create a presentation at the end of the program.
Something I feel I will bring to the experience is my ability to be organised and make sure I meet deadlines as needed.

My ability to work well with others and in diverse teams is something else I believe I will bring to the experience.

I believe that by further improving my reflective ability I will be able to draw lessons from tasks undertaken and improve upon these in future activities.  Throughout this learning experience I believe my brainstorming and idea generation skills will improve greatly through the use of the ideazone as a crowd sourcing tool. By collaborating with my peers to generate and expand on innovative ideas I expect that myself and my peers will greatly benefit from heightened team work skills. Furthermore I will gain real-world applicable experience from this unit, particularly when pitching my team’s idea to Deloitte’s industry professionals and/or partners.

I have good interpersonal skills and can communicate effectively with others. My experience from university and my workplace have helped me develop a strong analytic ability and highly effective team work skills. The experiences I have gained over my course include skills relative to business analysis, client pitches, business improvement proposals, information systems development and much more. It is my belief that the combination of these skills will greatly assist me to work effectively with my team to achieve synergy and deliver innovative solutions. General valuable skills I possess include organisation, punctuality and a strong work ethic, all of which I believe are necessary for the project.

I plan to use my involvement in Deloitte’s FASTRACK Innovation challenge to improve my skills in the subsequent areas: 

•	Design thinking,
•	Convergent thinking,
•	Problem solving skills, 

Furthermore, I want to use this experience to further improve my current skill set. In particular, focus will be placed on the improvement of the following skills: 

•	Critical thinking
•	Communication skills (i.e. effectively communicate with team members),
•	Presentation skills (i.e. ability to pitch numerous ideas in a concise manner). 

What skills and experiences do you already have that can contribute to this project?

I intend to utilise my experience with real-life consulting engagements and professional team development sessions to work effectively with other team members during the development of a functional business concept. The skills and experience acquired from working in the consulting service line will enable me to critically evaluate and deconstruct proposed business concepts at a granular level. 

My involvement in a professional work environment has facilitated the development of both my communication skills and my ability to think analytically. I believe that these skills will provide me with the confidence to accurately depict my ideas within a team environment as well as provide and receive constructive feedback. In my professional experience feedback assists in the creation of effective business concepts.

Furthermore, my time management skills and strong leadership qualities will assist me in organising and directing team discussion. This can be utilised to promote collaboration throughout the formation of the business concept.

I am excited going forward and really looking to put work into the program, exploring the learning opportunities. I think there are a lot of great, enthusiastic people here and once everyone becomes more comfortable the magic will start.

There are some good opportunities for me to look at improving myself by paying more attention to the program and dedicating myself to it for the next 3 months. I'm really happy to have something to work towards that is more structured than some of my other projects.

I have several tasks that I will accomplish over the next few days. The first is to view the content that I haven't viewed yet. I also want to start seeing more discussion on our project page even just to break the ice. I will start researching AMP's opinions on retirement and what they have done in the past. I have never thought much about the retirement of others although I spend a lot of time planning financial independence for myself. I hope to draw inspiration from my personal journey as well as teammates to truly make our think tank worthwhile.

Firstly, one of the most important skills is to build a good team player. A team project would fail easily if the team members do not know how to work with each other in a positive manner with strong team work spirit. The second skill is time management. Time management is a crucial skill that one should possess especially when each team member is not available at the same time. Punctuality and prioritizing tasks efficiently during the team meeting is the key to accomplishing a project within the stipulated timeline. I would also like to enhance my communication skill over the course. It is a very challenging task to work with people from diverse background. Sometimes, potential conflict among the team members could arise due to miscommunication. Hence, with a good communication skill, we can always avoid unnecessary conflicts. I worked as a Department Manager with H&M, the global apparel giant retail-clothing for a half year in 2012. I strongly believe that excellent communication skill being one of my strongest strengths as a manager at H&M. Without a good communication in the team, the usual business of the store will not operate smoothly and could turn out to be a bad shopping experience to the customers. Thus, it is important to be a strong leader with good communication skill in order to deliver the exceptional results of the business and provide an extraordinary experience to the customers. Also, being encouraging towards the effort of every member in the team is essential in order to achieve a goal simultaneously. Notwithstanding to the working experience I have as a manager at H&M, I would still want to improve myself and learn through the potential challenges arise from the course. The experience gained from the course will certainly be useful and applied in my family business in the future. Moreover, I believe this course will provide me an opportunity to interact with other team members. This helps to generate new ideas to be applied in any tasks as innovation is also one of the key to success.

It will be great opportunities to work with different people from various backgrounds and also will help me to enhance team awareness and team building skills. More important, I am also hoping that I can enhance the ability to identify the individual potential strength as well as opportunities so that I can well understand, manage and allocate human capacities. In another word, try to obtain more managerial thinking to achieve team work effectiveness and efficiency. Besides, I am also expecting to get more strategic thinking that I can quickly adapt different environment such as work with different people and meet challenges while I can also improve the ability to identify potential problem and conflict solving skills.

Firstly, I think my previous team work experience from the bachelor degree can provide me a professional work attitude to the team. And my knowledge from my major which are marketing and human resource give me a great interpersonally skill to communicate with people as well as I learned those professional course and business knowledge to apply in the team work. Moreover, my various working experience could bring more practical thinking and experience to the team and also I do have lots experience about the team work. In addition, my background that I live in two different cities and my culture will bring diversity. And personally, I am very creative and willing to meet challenges.

I consider working with new and different people is always a challenge but you can always learn from each other, share ideas and opinions and also can re-recognise yourself in a different ways. The other challenge could be this is a real project but we are university students that how we make it professional and practical which include time limitation, communication barriers and various expectations. It is still different with real working place. But I think it could be a great chance to learn or enhance time management skills, communication skills and team work awareness. In short, everyone could learn team building skill, interpersonal skill and business working ability and knowledge from the challenge that how we can make the team work more effectively.

I would love to see how I fare among-st different ideas, different people and different cultures. Being calm under pressure has not really been my forte and over the years I have made serious attempts to work on that. in this course I would like to experience pressure as a team and see how well I and my peers handle it .I would like to see how composed we are under pressure. In my last work place I had observed that people would jump into working towards a problem without brainstorming about the solution first. mainly because I think not everyone was on the same page about the problem at hand, through this course I intend to change that, in my team I would like to have this culture of brain storming as much as we could so that when we start working on the solution as a team. I believe only if you truly believe in something you can excel at it. Furthermore I am hoping to have a firsthand feel of how Australian corporations work and how money flows around here and at the same time imbibe the Australian work culture.
 I think I have good team work skills. I have this great ability to gel my team members together. I have a good idea of the practical business world and how it works, so I think I can analyze an idea on the basis of business viability. To add to that I have great financial analysis skills. I am creative and I have out of the box thinking capability .I am patient listener and I am not dismissive or condescending of anything or anyone -I entertain all ideas and possibilities. I have great time management skills and a good eye for detail. I am a people person and I always have a funny anecdote ready with me.
I think the greatest challenge would be to work together as a team  and on a same idea- platform.Another major challenge can be co-ordination between team members as some students are full time, some are part time and some are working.To add to that some team members do not have a business background so it can be challenging to educate them about the business aspects of the idea.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Firstly, I would like to develop teamwork skills. Teamwork is a fundamental part of entrepreneurship (and businesses in general). I would like to learn how to communicate effectively with other team members to create and build useful ideas and achieve quality outcomes.
Secondly, I would like to develop innovation skills. I would like to learn how to find or create a solution to a discovered problem in a chosen field, and build it into an active solution i.e. project.
Finally, I would like to develop my reflective writing and thinking skills further. These sorts of skills are intrinsic to who I am as an individual, as I constantly working on improving myself, but I would also like to learn how to communicate these aspects within a team and how to correctly build reflective processes in light of a particular project.

The skills and experiences that I already have and can contribute to this project include firstly, my research skills. I take great importance to research for all projects, as it is important to know what you are dealing with at all times within a project so that you can guide it to the most effective and successful outcome. I also have management experience in several creative projects, which included financial and resource preparation and allocation of tasks. But this is something I still wish to develop even further and on a higher scale.

The challenges that the Deloitte program will bring are many. They will include working with educated professionals of a higher level and involve greater problems over a broader market. They will also include dealing with failure after a long term investment, and learning from the experience to progress to the next stage.

I would like to create a balance between my critical and creative thinking. Lastly, I want to learn to use the power of persuasion in project pitching and convince clients that I am their best option. 

I have a background in engineering. I am excellent at analysing information/situation and come up with best solution possible. I demonstrate these skills through my internship experience at an engineering consultancy firm. I worked closely with my team in a vibrant setting and constantly develop and modify solutions to adhere clients’ needs. I believe that my qualification and experience had trained me to tackle problems with rational and logic and subsequently allow me to make inform decisions. 

The first challenge from this project will be selecting an idea from the team. This will involve several discussions and arguments within the group. It will be difficult to select one best solution that everybody agrees on. However, I will learn to give and take criticism and continue to grow. Another challenge will be the time constraint. This will put pressure on each team members and increase difficulty to come up with innovative solutions. To be able to overcome this, one will learn the ability to prioritise, multitask and time management. I can foresee a lot of challenges in the FAST TRACK programs but I interpret this as an opportunity to cultivate strength and improve my weaker skill sets.

During the teamwork and innovation class, we had a small team challenge where several tasks were to be completed within a limited time. When I was put into a team without knowing each team member's strengths and personality, I felt uncomfortable to distribute tasks to my team members. Even though our team managed to complete most of the tasks, we completed them in chaos. From this experience, I know this situation will occur again not only in the duration of the course but also the workplace in the future. Therefore it is important to develop the skills as mentioned above to avoid the same common mistakes a team encounters by being proactive and equipped with the skills needed to build a strong team. 
The skills and experience I have to contribute to this project is my interpersonal skill. I have worked as a resident assistant for 2 years and this job has enabled me to adapt quickly to work in a team. My team work closely with students to improve their experience in the accommodation and this requires a lot of communications and bondings with new faces every few months. I hope to be the character that connects each member in a team and use my interpersonal skill to facilitate a more efficient way of communication and thus create a harmonic working environment. 
Coordinating each member's strength is the most difficult thing to overcome in the project and is also one of the challenges that comes along with the project that I want to learn from. Furthermore, another challenge that I can learn from this project is how to encourage all the group members to put out the best effort in this project.

Other skills that I would want to develop are proactive decision making, analytical skills and the ability to practically transform an idea into a viable project.
I have worked in my family run business for a year and being from a business family, I have developed certain business and people skills that I can contribute to the project. The practical knowledge that I gained by working in a business helped me develop a perspective on business scenarios that would help me during the project. Being from India and working in the Indian environment, I can also bring diversity and a fresh opinion to the project.

Being an introvert, I don't usually take initiative, that I hope to change during this experience but, I have the ability to further strengthen and improve on an idea or process. I am co operative and patient when dealing with people, and possess a respect for all cultures and backgrounds. 
The project will pose numerous challenges, with the hardest among them being working closely in a culturally diverse team of people with different mindsets and ideologies, where a clash of opinions is bound to happen. From this experience, apart from developing team work abilities, I will develop a respect for people different than me and, the patience to deal with such clashes, and help resolve them that will benefit me immensely in my professional career. It will strengthen my people skills that I have learnt is one of the most important quality for professional success.

I think these skills will be valuable in my current employment and in my ambitions to try and achieve a small start-up on my own. Whilst I want to improve my own skillset I'm also confident that I can offer the following skills to my team and the cohort as a whole:
- Presentation Skills.
- Problem Solving.
- Organisation Skills.
- Scheduling.
- Teamwork.
- Leadership. and
- Collaborative Skills.

My experience as a Graduate Energy Advisor at SMEC Australia will also help me contribute knowledge on how businesses assess financial opportunities as well as technical knowledge regarding engineering ideas relevant to my field. Additionally, my background and experience in project management will help me manage my team's workload and help utilise all of their skills and experiences effectively.

I think the program will offer plenty of benefits but challenges along the way will be inevitable. Within my team I can foresee challenges related to
- Working together as a team.
- Managing and utilising conflict.
- Choosing a single idea to run with. and
- Organising time to work together.

Whilst these challenges may cause tension and frustration at the time I think they’ll be really beneficial in the long run as they prepare an individual for the nature of working in teams in the business world.

Overall I'm looking forward to the program and hope it can give me an edge in my field as well as be fun and thought provoking!",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

What skills are you hoping to develop over the course of this experience?

Solving problems has always fascinated me. I like to start things, be it start ups, initiatives, causes - and then love the adrenaline rush that comes with it. I am very enthusiastic and confident about every task/project I take up in life. The Deloitte Fastrack Innovation Challenge is an extremely interesting program and I hope to develop the following skills over the course of this experience:

1.	By working in a culturally diverse yet rich team, it would broaden my horizon and perspective about the business world.
2.	I would get a chance to expand my network, interact with industry professionals and mentors directly. This would be an incredible learning opportunity and a great way to enrich my networking skills.
3.	It would give me a chance to apply the key learnings from this experience for future business projects.
4.	This project experience would help me get launched into my desired profession of Management Consulting by developing and honing my work ready skills.
5.	This innovation incubation program experience would allow me to work directly with leading companies (and clients) on real business problems. 
6.	This program experience would also help me apply my theoretical knowledge to provide practical solutions to client challenges and problems.
7.	By the end of the program, I would expand and sharpen my business acumen as well.


Ques 2. What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?

Skills that I already have –
1.	Excellent leadership skills.
2.	High level of confidence and outgoing nature.
3.	Team management skills.
4.	Global leadership exposure.
5.	Comfortable working in a multi-cultural environment.
6.	Excellent networking skills
7.	Highly effective public speaking and business communication skills.
8.	Great inter – personal skills.
9.	Corporate management skills.
10.	Organisational skills.
11.	Time management skills.
12.	Effective contributor in team projects.

The following gives a brief overview of my past experiences that made me acquire the above skill set :

During my undergraduate and high school days, I was actively involved in organising and managing large scale events and conferences. During my school days I was involved in organising and leading events like Annual Book Week, Annual Sports Meet and Anti Cracker Campaigns. Similar to a manager in a company, I had constant pressure of keeping up with tight deadlines, motivating members and ensuring that quality work was produced at all times.

To incorporate the essence of my management skills in the real world scenarios, I challenged myself with summer internships at Celebi and FedEx Express as a Sales and Marketing Intern and Inside Sales Intern respectively. The experience I gained from these two internships was invaluable. Besides further enhancing my confidence and inter-personal skills, it also gave me an insight of the business world. From both internships, I realised that without communication, any Business would crumble, as different departments would not liaise with each other, causing a waste of resources.

Studying at one the best universities in India had given me the ideal milieu to excel both academically and outside the class. Not only I had been consistently ranked in the top 10% of the batch but I was pro active in college extra curricular activities as well. I was the President of the Technical Society (A.C.E) , one of the core-organisers of a TEDx Conference (TEDxSGGSCC) at my university and have hosted events for Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, The Chief Minister of Delhi. Through my communication, leadership and organisational skills, I have always motivated team members, ensured quality work is delivered on time and have overcome difficulties by promoting a team-based attitude amongst my colleagues, guiding them with pre-scheduled timelines and conducting continuous review sessions to resolve difficulties. Thus, we have been able to deliver successful projects. Being a team leader, the rights of decision-making come with lots of responsibilities as well. As the Placement Coordinator of the College Placement Cell, I was the prime source of contact between the potential recruiters and the students. My decisions had to ensure constant appreciation of the college students. This position helped me train myself in carefully evaluating all the aspects and possibilities before forming conclusions. It taught me the importance of group dynamics in a diverse team and certainly shaped me into a better team leader. For me, the best of my ability is clearly displayed under such pressurising situations. 

These positions and achievements are just a glimpse of my hard work and dedicated nature. I have also been awarded the prestigious ""Business Leader Postgraduate Scholarship"" by University of Sydney.

Also integral to my personality is my global exposure. I represented India at Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) 2014 held in Arizona, USA. CGI U is an initiative of President Bill Clinton and it brings together world leaders to take on global challenges. Interacted with delegates from 90 countries and discussed about global issues with elite personalities like President Bill Clinton, Hilary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and Bill Drayton. Also served as a Campus Representative of CGI U 2015 and my responsibilities involved promoting CGI U and serving as a direct link between CGI U Team and prospective applicants.

I also represented India at The Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations (HPAIR) 2013 Asia Conference held in Dubai, organized by the prestigious Harvard University. Here I interacted with people from over 40 countries across the globe. It has broadened my perspectives and taught me to view the world with a pragmatic angle. 

I had also been invited to represent India at the 18th World Business Dialogue organised by University of Cologne in Germany. It’s the world’s largest student run business convention and I was 1 of the 200+ students selected to participate in the convention.

I was also selected as a Representative of India for the One Young World Summit (OYW), Dublin. The One Young World Summit attracts young, brilliant minds that are driven to change the world, who want to make a difference and improve lives of the people around them. That is what makes them exceptionally incredible minds. Also, have also been invited to represent India at other global forums like Awesomeness Fest, Thailand . Asean Future Leaders Summit, Malaysia and International Youth Forum, India.

I am an extremely social and outgoing person who loves people. I am touted as a “Networker/Connector”, but the truth is that I just like being among people all the time. My network connections extend to various global networks like – HPAIR (Harvard University), Clinton Global Initiative University, One Young World, The Kairos Society, World Business Dialogue, TED Community and the World Economic Forum - Global Shapers Community. Having global friends make me feel it’s a very small and a well-connected world we are living in at the moment and we all could learn something from each other and pay it forward to shape the future of the world.

I am very comfortable and confident in effectively communicating with friends, professionals and strangers alike. I believe this quality is very important while networking because confidence is the key to everything in life.

Ques 3.	What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?

Every project faces challenges. Some challenges might be petty while some may require a great deal of time to get solved. Potential challenges that might arise over the course of this experience are:
1.	Clash of opinions and ideas – Since this shall be a group project work, it is highly likely that there will be clash of opinions between team members now and then. The ideal method to solve this would be to take every idea into consideration and then take a final call as to which idea/method the team should go forward with.
2.	Different business practices in different countries – As we all know the project teams would be culturally rich and diverse, with students walking in from different career backgrounds and countries. Businesses are conducted in different fashion in  different countries and this might lead to difference in opinions with respect to culture, language, beliefs and world views. A positive aspect to this point is that it will bring fresh perspectives onto the table and every team member could learn something new which could be well utilised by him/her in future business practices.
3.	Another potential challenge that could be possible is where in one or the other team members is not working consistently and other team members covering up for him/her. This is an extremely unprofessional way of working and required steps must be taken from the starting to ensure that the timeline and task schedule is effectively followed by one and all. It would hone and sharpen the time management skills of all the team members and train them to keep up with the strict deadlines.
4.	Personality clashes is another potential challenge that one could face. One team member could be of type – ENFP while the other could be an INTJ Type.
5.	Wrong delegation of tasks and duties amongst the team members. Every member has a certain set of strong and weak skills. To ensure successful completion of the project on a timely basis, each member should ensure that they assign each other the work that would reflect their positive traits rather than the negative ones. One of the team members could have great presentation and communication skills while the other one can be strong in analysing and researching. So the tasks should be delegated effectively and correctly.
6.	Not setting effective achievable goals could result in a lot of problems for the team at the end.
7.	Only focussing on problems and not on solutions is another potential challenge a team could face. If the team is not clear about its goals and objectives then it won’t be able to deliver the result on time.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Furthermore, I hope to develop my skills as an innovator through the experiential learning method. I believe that through trial and error, the Fastrack Challenge will teach me how to come up with new approaches to problems through trial and error, methodology development and research.

I have recently started to work at a technology start-up, thus I have been able to develop a high level of autonomy when approaching my tasks. This experience means that I need little guidance as I am able to develop a method for attacking problems and projects without a set structure. I also have communication and empathy skills, allowing me to understand the point of view of others. Through this, I can come to a compromise between my view and the view of my team members. I believe this allows me to effectively work in a team as it leads to the creation of an optimum recommendation or solution, whereby the best aspects of each view are combined. Furthermore, I am analytic in my approach to projects, using theoretical views to help me gain a holistic view of the problem and issues at task. This allows me to develop a logical understanding of what needs to be done, keeping me on track with the development of projects that I work on.

I understand that the Deloitte Fastrack Challenge will challenge my communication skills, whereby I expect at some point that I or my team will need to explain to other members who potentially have greatly varied views to the majority as to how the team thinks a certain method is superior. I expect that this will lead to me learning how to deal with conflict in a team environment. I also expect to learn how 
each person's unique skills, capabilities and views can be brought together to create an optimum result. Lastly, I envision that there will be challenges pertaining to power struggles and the team's hierarchy, allowing me to learn how to deal with people who want total control, as well as those who want to freeload and not contribute.

Furthermore, during this course I am also hoping to improve my business skills because of my background is based on engineering which is not very relevant. However, I could provide any technical solutions for the project which other background might not come up with. 
The skills I already have would be research, cooperation and support. I worked on my thesis project last year base on mass paper reading which directly improved my research skills of finding relevant papers to the certain area no matter for engineering topic or another subjects. I worked as two different teams during undergraduate study which make me accumulated a lot of experience to work as a team with cooperation skills to achieve a common goal.

I have a small company in China, which was built in 2012. I'm planning to make it bigger and find a new way to broaden my business road. This class can give me new idea, new technology and new method of managing a company. I majored in Economics for my undergraduate years in America, so I have the basic theory of economy and business. But I lack actual experience. That’s why I opened a restaurant in Beijing. From this experience, I decided to learn management for my postgraduate degree. I want to improve myself. To learn more knowledge on management, I can make my company more efficient, and I can balance different parts of operation. By knowing innovation, I can catch on the development of the global market and make my company survive. Because the world economy is not good right now, so many industries may bankrupt at any time.   Only knowing the advanced business type can help my company getting better. 
     For our project, I think I already have experience on leadership and designing. When we did the game, I could assign my team mate to different at the beginning of the game. It saved the time and let us become more connected. We won the tower game. We all expressed our opinions on designing the tower. I'm so glad they used my idea. 
     The biggest challenge I have met was that my thinking is limited. I can only think of a thing in a specific way, if that idea not working, I cannot find another one. Moreover, I need to learn more on teamwork. When I am in a group, I always want to be the leader. But in fact, so many people are better than me, I need to be modest and learn from them.

Using the Fastrack experience, I am hoping to develop a more comprehensive set of teamwork and collaborative skills. In previous team situations, I have often found it challenging to channel the enthusiasm of each team member into the achievement common objective. To manage a successful and competitive project, my team and I will need to ensure this is managed appropriately.

Additionally, I am hoping to develop my creative and time management skills. My feeling is that the Fastrack program will have high creative expectations in a time-pressured environment. I expect this journey to equip me with many of these skills, and adequately prepare me for the creative and time-pressured expectations of a corporate workplace.


What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?

My professional communicative skills and experience will be of benefit for my team’s project. Having worked in various professional settings, including on boards and in local and central government, I have the skills to conduct successful meetings with prospective stakeholders. Through these experiences I have also learnt to be proactive and pursue every avenue available to reach an objective.

Alongside my leadership skills, I bring managerial experience. I have tailored these skills throughout my time as a national political leadership campaign media strategist and as a leader of various campaigns to promote a new constitutional order for New Zealand. I also bring presentation and design skills that will enable my team’s project to be pitched professionally with x-factor.


What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?

The inclusion of a range of individuals with differing expertise, working habits, schedules, priorities, cultures, and ideas may present a challenge in group discussion and decision making settings. I experienced many of these challenges during the simple orientation exercises complete in our first session — and it became clear that the entire Fastrack program would present similar obstacles.

I am also expecting time constraints to be a significant challenge. My understanding of the Fastrack program is that there will be tremendous pressure on producing the maximum results in the shortest space of time. I expect this potential challenge to prepare me for the pace of the corporate sector and equip me valuable time management skills.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

As well as my team work skills I am sure this experience will push me to develop essential innovative skills, to come up with new ideas and ways to adapt an existing idea to a situation if it does not currently work. I feel like these two elements will also constitute the biggest challenges the experience will bring. Seeing an idea fail and having to either start again or adapt it greatly in order for it to work can be very challenging, especially if one has been working on the same idea for a while and it is the only vision you have. This experience will teach me to accept failure in a positive way and see it as a learning curve and an opportunity to improve the ideas one already came up with, an essential lesson to learn in life and the business world. 

Secondly, working successfully in a team will be another great challenge. Even though I have strong personal skills and can work well with most people, which is an attribute I think I can contribute to this project, there are always clashes between different personalities in a group. Different personalities are essential and can bring so much to a team, but I think it is also important to learn to tone down your personality if it is creating blockage and preventing any advances from being made. I think I work well in a team, but I also think I have a lot to learn. I am a motivational person and can convey this to others in order to motivate them to do there best. However, I also think I can sometimes want to take charge, and will need to develop my patience and allow others to also fulfill this role. I think making sure everyone in the group is heard and everyone is listening and taking into consideration their ideas is also an essential skill to learn, and will also be a challenge, especially when some people are focused on their own view and will not accept someone saying otherwise or suggesting a different approach. 

Furthermore, I have strong organisational skills which will be an essential contribution to this project. These skills will help with distributing the various roles to group members, organising meetings and the different steps of the project, and attacking the project in a logical manner rather than every team member jumping in and trying to do it their own way. However, this will create a challenge for me as well, coming back to the idea of taking charge too much and wanting to organise everything. 

Finally, I am also hoping to develop my business skills. I am looking forward to learning how a business project is formed and all the different stages of its life up to the business pitch. I think we will develop a number of very important skills which will be key for us in the business world after the Master of Management.

Throughout the course I want to learn and fully understand how the ideation and innovation processes work. reinforcing these ideas, therefore being able to use them at any stage in my future. Spend time building productive relationships and then learning how to best manage the interactions and relationships in the team to lead to performance. I want to use the teamwork skills that I have developed in my high performance rowing career and translate them into another performance environment to drive success and comradery.

What skills and experiences do I already have that I can contribute to this project?
I have years of experience working within teamwork situations, and have over this time understood certain important aspects of teamwork. I feel that a common goal is important, however not as important as individual purpose and hooking into that purpose to help drive each individual towards the goal.  From years of self-critiquing, I would argue that I have good self reflection skills, this has shaped who I am (although I am often over critical of myself) and I enjoy learning, particularly actively. While these are key parts of me that I can contribute to the group and learning process, I have a strong analytical approach, allowing me to focus objectively on discussion points and concepts.

What potential challenges do I think will arise over the course of this experience that I can learn from?
Failure- Part of the ideation and lean launchpad method of innovation involves rapid failure, and a big challenge for me will be to get my head around the idea of failing, that it is okay, part of the process, and will be necessary to succeed. I know that I will struggle with this idea, as I hate the feeling of failure, but I think that if I do not get too swept up in the particular ideas and remain objective, I will manage to overcome this, and hopefully succeed (learn , apply, and win...)

Also, since our teammates come from different countries with various education background, the ways or pattern of thinking and solving problems could be highly different. There could possibly occur divergence of opinion within groups, I hope this would be a chance that I can develop and gain a better communication skills. 

2) From my previous study and other working experience, I have developed teamwork skill. I am willing to take own responsibility within the team and contribute all my ideas and skills to the team through out the project I engaged during undergraduate study. Team leadership skill always help group members to build a positive working relationship. In a marketing research project my group conduct with a small business, I was in charge of setting meetings with  the client, developing the common objectives for project and as a guide for each research we did gradually. I am an outstanding team leader as I am also willing to encourage my team members when they are facing with stress and problems. 

3) I am expecting face any challenge that may occur during the project. The basic innovation challenge could appear at the beginning of the project. I need to have a critical and comprehensive understanding of the business and the project itself. The innovation idea need to combine both creativity and reality issues. Then a problem of understanding the real business context could be arisen from the process of conducting the idea-zone. There also could be communication problems and conflict within the group, as members are with various education and culture backgrounds, ways of thinking could be conflicted.

The skills that I am hoping to develop over the course of this experience are better teamwork skills and the associated emotional intelligence around group dynamics and how I can better position or lead a team. I believe this skill is essential in many forms of work, especially in my future career.

Similarly, I hope to develop stronger professional communication skills. In past teams that I have been in, I have noted that I have been too withdrawn, or too extroverted as well as noticing that I can waffle on at times. I hope to increase my level of calibration with regards to this which will hopefully lead to more efficient and effective communication amongst my team members.

2. I have existing experience as a professional and student consultant, with the professional experience also encompassing project management. I believe that this will come in handy when dealing with the organisational challenges that come with the project, though as the context and subject matter are different, I will have to take care and not try and ‘force fit’ any existing methodologies which I believe may be suitable for a situation. 

3. Potential challenges I foresee arising over the course of this experience are clashes in terms of work styles. I have seen this happen and have experienced cases where communication and workflows were not normalised and this has led to miscommunication, frustration and reduced morale amongst the team. 

As well as this, I believe there may be some difficulty in terms of ideation and collaboration with regards to our project. Due to different ideas on how our idea may work or conflicting ideas, resolving these may take some time and may lead to some team members not being utilised effectively (for example if our idea is more about finances, people with a non-business background may not feel as if they are contributing).

And secondly, I also hope to be able to recognise my own management style throughout the team work during this semester, so that I can perform myself better in the position of a team leader.

During my three-year bachelor study of Public Relations, I was trained as an ethical and responsible communication professional whilst developing a range of skills that include: campaign production, media liaison, research plus event management. These skills I believe have prepared me well for this course. The past few years I have dedicated myself to gaining experience in the communication sector across a range of organisations. These types of companies include traditional family owned business, Australia’s largest department store group, multinational and transnational organisation.  This has given me a real insight the question of corporate and organisational culture, whilst gaining valuable personal and practical experience. My other profound experience including working with the state government during 2014 G20 Forum and as well as big national events such as Australia Day.

The challenges I would think of would be the expectation gap between our ideas and when they are putting into practical use. It is always the case that prior to developing a proposal, we tend to have high expectation of our ideas. But things could happen that ideas can be altered and changed several times before being put into use. The ability to deal with changes is very essential and it will be the challenge to overcome as well. The other potential challenges I would think of are the integration between on-line learning system and in-class learning, it can be tricky to pinpoint the important relating content and prepare well. And how to divide the time equally could be a challenge as well as how to maximise the learning resources.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I was frequently used as a focal point for resolving disputes between team members. For example, during my military service I helped three soldiers in my team to settle their disagreements. I believe such experiences will allow me to utilize my mediation skills and interpersonal skills to help overcome potential arguments and obstacles between teammates.  
Second, this project is expected to be challenging and frustrating at times. Previous personal experience required me to develop resilience and a positive outlook. Owing to that, I can strengthen the team by exemplifying tolerance and patience, offer optimism, and contribute to team moral. 
Third, leadership is a phenomenon that is either claimed by someone or happens naturally. I believe in quiet leadership that happens naturally and maintain that individuals take on different leadership roles simultaneously in a team. However, I am one to take the wheel and steer when work becomes difficult, or when the situation feels stuck and a change is required. 

I hope to develop my presentation skills and communicate with confidence when presenting to a crowd full of people.  I think this experience affords an opportunity to Improve presentation skills and pitching techniques. 
I wish to further develop my communication skills generally, and specifically in the context of interacting within a multicultural team. I look forward to see how we bridge the gap of diversified cultural backgrounds and communicate effectively within the team. 
I believe the project will strengthen my skills in conducting research and sharpen techniques on how to collect objective and reliable information. 

Three challenges that I identify: 
1. Utilizing the skills of all team members effectively. That is, to identify the skills that are strongest in each teammate and to use that as an advantage for the benefit of the team, in order to produce the best possible output. 
2. Generating valuable innovative ideas. The challenge is to nurture the idea, provide sufficient information to back it up and establish the relevance of the idea, as well as to make the notion of turning that idea into reality applicable to real life. 
3. Attracting our mentors’ attention, creating a shared interest for them to engage in our project and justify their time spent with us.

Particularly, one in which we will have very diverse backgrounds, skills, ways of thinking and doing, as well as preferences. I want to develop my skills in respectfully negotiating these challenges, perhaps by bringing it back to a process or framework such as lean innovation, value propositions and business model canvassing. I hope these will contribute to a suite of skills at my disposal to equalise or capapitalise the divergent styles and contributions of group members to ultimately make me an asset to whatever team or project I am involved with. 

I am hoping to become better at listening to the contributions of others no matter how they are able to present them. To not rush over things or dwell too long on them when it is fruitless. That is, to become better at telling the difference. Perhaps by becoming increasingly adept at rapidly cycling through the lean innovation cycle which is a method that makes it more about the idea and less about the ego of the person. 

I am hoping to increase my confidence in delivering the value of mine and my team's ideas when they appear to be robust. I hope to learn the skill of pitching to critics without becoming defensive or too flustered. To depersonalise ideas I think are great so that they are open to a rigorous scientific-style method of hypothesising and experimentation, ultimately making way for improvements and developments. 

I believe that I have the capacity to quickly generate novel ideas and solutions that approach problems from unusual perspectives. I have the ability to flexibly adapt my thinking and approach as a problem space changes or existing attempts become untenable. I have quality skills in communication that will hold across  written and verbal platforms and feel comfortable speaking off the cuff and thinking on my feet. I have skills in time management, delivering tangible outcomes to diverse stakeholders, working to broad and specific briefs as well as collaborating in a team setting to achieve goals. I also believe that I am open and willing to shift for the benefit of the project or group to ensure stagnation does not occur.

I see some challenges arising through this experience. These include, balancing my work and study commitments, overcoming conflict effectively within my group, ensuring that time committed to this work is used efficiently, becoming familiar with a more corporate professional environment and learning to understand and speak the 'language' of this world to achieve my goals.

Business knowledge, business analysis, problem-solving, communication and critical thinking are the skills I want to develop over Deloitte fastrack experience.
Fastrack project is very attractive. It creates a platform to connect lecture with real world business, and helping student develop key skills through business project especially for no business background students.
I want to develop business knowledge because i don’t have much from undergraduate education, and i want to know more. Fastrack provide a chance that allow students apply business theory into real business projects, so we can understand knowledge better.  
Analysis, critical thinking, problem-solving and communication are also key skills that can be develop through the course. Real project is very different with what we learned from lecture, it is more complex and dynamic in different situations. Analysis and critical thinking can help to  make right decisions, problem-solving and communication are keys to run the business, they all can be beneficial throughout career.

2.
Teamwork, communication, design skills and working experiences are what i can contribute to the project. I am good at teamwork, i can coordinate teammates and make easy team communications. 
I have design skills as an architecture student before and working experiences from past job and practice.
And also as s a international student at Sydney uni, i have the ability to deal culture differences, and i have very strong ethical and social responsibilities.

3.
I think the most challenge part of this project is adopting ourselves into real businesses, again it is so different with lecture knowledge, we will face something we never heard of and manage to overcome them. Eventually we will learn plenty from what we experienced and develop them into our careers.
However, there are challenges all through the course, such as analysis, research and presentation, but i will enjoy the challenges because they are the keys towards success.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

First of all, the strategy. In my work, I only have plan, which means I only can plan my schedule or my goal for a short time period for like three month or half year, but it is not enough for working as a manager, sometimes I thought about stragegy, but after analyse the fact, I just gave up, because there are so many limitation in the real world, that stop me to make a stragegy for business. Secondly, I want improve my leadership. I worked alone, because I response for my own part, I don't have partner in my job, sometimes, I only know how to manage others rather than work with others. Maybe my workmates feel uncomfortable, its not a good direction to go in the business.
The skill I can contribute to this project is sales skill and communication skill. I worked as a export manager in a machine manufactory. I sold machines to hundreds of customers all around the world, most of them from developing coutries. In my experience, I think the most powerful weapon for young people is the honest. It will helps so much in career.

I already consider myself to be an energetic and creative individual, yet it is through the business project that I hope to enhance such skills in a more professional manner. In saying such, the financial side of the management course - in conjunction with the Deloitte Fastback programme - will acquire me with the skills that would enable to me to better succeed in establishing my own business in the future.  

The skills that I believe I already bring to the projects is that I am a firm believer in team work when it comes to solving large scale problems, or managing any amount of capital. The business project will allow me with the opportunity to explore everyones ideas, and enhance them to overcome any hurdles that may eventuate.  
I am also a creative thinker, someone who can think outside of the box, while still having a 'real world' perspective. I believe the business project will encourage individuals to be innovative in their ideas, and it is such creative skills that would become an asset in due course. 
I also have a keen interest in digital technology, and exploring its use in professional environments. Previous internships has lead me to be an avid media consumer, which I believe could possibly help within the development stages of the business project.  

The challenges that I may face, is that there is the likely possibility that there may be a clash in my team, and the group dynamics may not work well. However the case may be, one often doesn't choose who they collaborate with in professional environments, and I believe that working with what you have is something I can learn.

This time I would like to do a proper planning in the early stage, especially prioritizing. Prioritizing the tasks, I mean, is to separate major tasks and the minor ones. In this way, I may work more efficiently.  
Personally, I have a good communication skill. The experience of working in a NGO team, initiating plans, discussing with others and finally reaching to the consensus facilitates me an excellent interpersonal communication skill. As a result, I may communicate with my team more efficiently. Simultaneously, the experience of establishing my own English club in university when I was a sophomore and leading it to the top three popular associations within two years forms me a strong leadership skill and this skill is likely to assist my team in decision making.
Many challenges may arise during the process. Conflict, for example, is probably the most common one since nearly all members in a team may have their different opinions. Therefore, how to communicate with them effectively and eventually resolve those conflicts is very crucial. Another challenge is that I may probably have to learn some new skills and knowledge when we were allocated to a new project which I am not familiar with at all. To adapt the new situation, I may do some research and ask peers, mentors and even some experts in that certain area for advice. Finally, tolerant to the stressed situations, especially time limit, is also a big problem that I should adapt during the whole process.

As was emphasised in the introduction to the course, failure is certain, profound and frequent and I believe that this is an area that I need to work on so that I am able to learn and grow from such situations. 
I would like to see the program prompt me to apply my design thinking skills in the corporate world and in an organisational context to gain confidence in the process of innovation, from conceptualisation to realisation. 
I would like to learn how best to enable a team to draw upon the knowledge, expertise and experiences of other members, including their cultural differences in order to synthesise individual visions for a project and develop an effective outcome. 
Feedback is an integral component of any development and I would like to see myself making the most of each tiny insight and lesson from the workings of real world professionals through their input to this program. It takes practise to be able to effectively incorporate an external opinion into your own project and this is a skill that I wish to refine.

Group work and pitching played a key role in my undergraduate degree and I understand the importance, benefits and challenges of such ventures, however I believe that both teamwork and presentation skills can always and should always be continually built upon through exposure and experience to as broad and diverse projects and circumstances as possible. I believe that this experience may assist me in understanding some of what awaits in the journey ahead, particularly in regard to the turbulence of teamwork. 
The focus of my undergraduate course was design thinking which I consider very relevant to innovation. They share similar foundations and processes and I intend to use this learning and experience to my teams advantage particularly in the development phase. 
The degree also provided me with the practical design skills necessary to brand and represent our innovation in an attractive and coherent a manner in order to heighten its impact in a pitch and hopefully take further the results and hard work of our innovation. 
Finally as previously mentioned, my undergraduate involved pitching. I have learnt and practiced the process of selling an idea or development to a range of audiences and panels which I hope to be a useful contribution.

I see teamwork as a major challenge, but I look forward to what I will be able to learn from the other members in my group and the process of establishing ourselves as an effective and efficient team. This will teach patience, conscientiousness and perseverance and I am sure will open my eyes to many other factors that cannot be foreseen.

Firstly, I am focusing to improve my communication skills as I think that my communication skill is poor and need to improve greatly. After giving some thought, I realise that coming from the creative industry, where you need to have ideas or principal to believe in and hold on to, sometimes makes it harder to accept other people’s opinion thus creating a barrier to communicate with others. I am hoping to change that, as I want to communicate better with my team members and colleagues in the future. Second skill that I want to improve is disciplinary, I think the working method in the creative design industry has made me indiscipline, I only do my work whenever I have a mood to do it as in design world you cannot just do the work without ideas and sometimes ideas do not come to you straight away even if you want it to. I hope that I can change that in the near future as I think this problem makes me unproductive. Patience is an aspect that I want to achieve. Sometimes I feel that I need to get something done quickly, but I have not done the process of doing it which makes that something not perfect. I want to learn to be patience, to learn the process of learning something slowly and doing it right.
An attitude of willingness to learn is one of my skills, I just want to know what I do not know and want to know it in detail and in the fastest time possible for me to understand. I really cannot stand of not knowing something, it bothers me until I research about it and understand it. Coming up with unique idea and creative thinking is one of the top priority in design, this experience has taught me how to think and look at a different perspective to solve a problem.

Managers, as central role in a team, should be good plan makers. However, it is not easy to make an effective plan that drives the whole project towards success. Through reflection on the teamwork based activities in class, I summed up some useful skills to deal with issues related to plan making. These skills, in the long run, would definitely be beneficial to my whole life as a manager.

From my perspective, the strength of making an effective plan would be that it clearly illustrates a goal and the ways to achieve it. Forming a good plan is not just simply writing down whole list of things you intend to do, it should cover single steps required in order to achieve that outcome. Specifically, it encompasses (1) steps (2) number of people needed in each part (3) action timeline. A problem I encountered in working in my group was that we didn't allocate different tasks to different members, most of us just watching 3 people busily building the structure. We finally run out of time and have to omit almost half of the original sketch. If we separate the big task into small pieces and allocate it for small groups (2 to 3) in a team, it will save more time. This experience inevitably mirrors a few small but important things I overlook in my life. It gave me a better understanding of my strength and weakness in a team. I am good at making an overall plan (I contributed a sketch to my team and they all accepted it), but fail to allocate tasks reasonably. In addition, other potential challenges would arise in a team are the disagreement of ideas, the unfair tasks allocation, or the inability to finish tasks etc., I realise that every time in the future I facing similar situation, I should allocate appropriate tasks to appropriate team members within appropriate time, in order to maximise the team value (1+1>2) and also it is a good way to show my respect to each member for their contribution to team success.

I am also not competitive if i don't feel like i have a good chance at winning. In the first orientation seminar i was quite intimidated by the competitive nature of my class mates and felt quite out of my depth. Hopefully this teamwork and innovation experience will help me boost my confidence in working with a team - with an assortment of different personalities, loud ones and quiet ones so that we can negotiate as a group and come up with an effective idea and effective strategy. I was never good at team sports so i am worried. But i am also trying to be as optimistic as i can.

I have worked as a manager of glassies and cellar man at the pub i work out for around a year now. I lead a team of 3 or 4 glassies/cellarman to effectively clean the pub of glasses, vomit, faeces and dirty tables on weekdays and especially busy weekend nights. I have quite personal interactions with all members of my team and feel like i can connect with them on a personal level, increasing our work ethic together and making sure that my team doesnt see me as just a leader, but also as a team member working hard with them to make the night run smoothly. I feel like my inter-personal skills in bringing people together and making sure conflict is diminished will be valuable asset to the team. 

This may cause challenges as some team members may view me as a threat or a bully if i am unable to connect with them properly. In the teamwork challenge last week I asked a man from another team if he could help us out with a task as we were struggling to find people to help us with the knots game (as all other teams had already worked together and there was an uneven number of teams). He was very willing to help me out (thanks to my skills at connecting with people) yet his team treated me with hostility as they were very competitive and didn't want to lose a member for a few minutes nor help another team out. My outlook on life is not like that. I believe in helping all teams out. We are all running different races in life. Yet that doesn't mean I am just going to focus on running my own. I take pleasure in helping others with their own. Almost to the point where i forget about mine entirely.

In working with a team, I aim to develop skills in communication, stakeholder engagement, project management and pitching projects within a professional context.
In following the Lean LaunchPad Innovation Cycle, I believe that each of the four main phases will nurture my skills in corporate innovation, data research and understanding how to meet financial goals.

Prior to 2015, I have had experience working in teams at a professional level and I hope to utilise my skills to contribute to this project. During my Bachelor of Music (Performance) I was a member of a string quartet that was chosen to represent the Sydney Conservatorium of Music on a two-week tour of Italy. I have also performed in classical and jazz orchestras with professional musicians. Through music, I have developed skills in perseverance, time management, music innovation, performing in high-pressure situations, flexibility and communicating with clients.
Additionally, I work in teams of up to 10 people in orchestral management and tutoring Maths, English and Music. These contexts of work have developed my business acumen, responsibility, multi-tasking and openness to suggestions for improvement.

When working in a team there are many potential challenges that could lie ahead. Through this project I hope to learn from the challenges in team relationships, accepting and effectively using constructive criticism, productively working within time constraints, being creative on all levels and working to achieve a common goal. I believe that there will be many setbacks and pivots at different stages of the innovation process, however through perseverance and effective teamwork, these challenges can be overcome.

To be more specific, the MMGT6011 are focus on teamwork and innovation, it have lot of activity in class to help the me cooperate with each other and also competition with different team. In this situation, I consider it could help me to know my classmate, learn how to be a good team member and know the important of teamwork in the whole society. As for organize a good team, in this course, it really could help us know the step, the core content and how to lead a team.  Furthermore,  in this course it will push us to solve the problem in the real world. In my opinion, it is quiet useful, cause the student might face the problem similar in the future works, it is a valuable experiences for the student.

Secondly, as a partner I had do the red wine export business and I have involved in an acquisition project of real estate in Melbourne. As for do the red wine business, I am responsible for the E-marketing and logistic, so I have bit of experience about how do the internet sale, what should worry about the product delivering. For the acquiring project, I know some information about  what should concern when we acquiring and what is the general step of acquiring project.

In this course, it will fcae lots of challenge, there are few reasons. To start with, if I want to be a good team member, I have to try my best to do  the part of job which is belong to me. Moreover, if the team face the problem, all the team members need to communicate and to solve the problem. Thirdly, in the discussion, it may have different opinion and even some argue, all of team member should solve.

I have always believed in succeeding with my team i.e. leave no person behind. I will also like to develop my networking, presentation, communications, creative thinking, data research & data analysis skills, as these are also fundamental elements in personal and professional progression as well as necessary for effective innovation.
   
I have worked in various business functions such as HR, Marketing & Business Development for some of the finest multinationals, as well as have already worked on development and execution of various innovative projects that have been a source of financial gain for the company directly or via development of its people.

Irrespective of the fact that I have worked in teams, have researched and analyzed data for various projects, I feel that it will still be a challenge throughout this project (mainly as I don’t have much knowledge on Deloitte and its clients). Failure is another part of this project that I may have to face on and off. How to get back up when you fail along with learning how to deal with other challenges such as data gathering and analysis etc. is something I will be more than willing to do during the course of this project.

This sentence is pretty much describing my condition. As an international student, getting a master degree in Australia is not an easy thing. I come from ordinary family which could not afford international education for her daughter. Even more, for daily life, I need to work in order to lighten my family burden. Thus, to be in this course, I need to get a scholarship beforehand. After passed hardship of getting a scholarship, I do not want all the hard work became waste. I want to maximize this course for my personal and career development.

Personal development aims to develop essentials skills set which needed by someone. In many previous circumstances, I did not have confidence to speak up my opinion or convince other about my idea. Maybe it was also because my family background and my culture that shaped me like that. I tend to do more listening, rather than speaking. But then, I realized, my own condition is determined by my actions. Now, I am trying to change my current condition and probably my future, by coming out from my comfort zone and coming to Australia. In this course, I want to come out of my comfort zone by developing public speaking skills and negotiation skills. I believe by interacting with multicultural students from all over the world as a team, my public speaking and negotiation skills will be developed. These skills will also help me to develop my career journey in the future. 
Not only desire to be developed personally, I also want to contribute to develop my team in this course. I think I am good at time management. Before went to Uni, I was worked as Marketing Assistant in FMCG company. I knew everyone in the team has different priorities. still, it is my job to unite the team by arranging perfect time for all of us to have meetings or to remind all the members to do or submit their work in time. I could be very tiresome for someone who is hated to be reminded. But in the end, I know, time keeper is necessary for every team. Therefore, I could help this project by helping my team to set the timeline and make time arrangement for every stage that we should get over with. 

In reality, not every plan comes smoothly. Even in this course, there are several potential challenges that may be arisen, such as, language challenges, differentiation in work culture, fair task allocation, and internal team conflict. All of those challenges have been predicted. Yet, knowing a big benefit will come from facing these challenges, make me all excited about this course. I hope this course will be a good opportunity for me and all classmates to be prepared in the real work and real life out there.

Challenges I foresee are the conflicts that may arise due to the team dynamic. Through such challenges, I will be able to learn conflict management, interpersonal skills, how to build a high performing team at work and of course gain experience on what to do and what not to do when it comes to group projects. This will be a great experiential learning project for me to understand myself and how I work with the others.

The fastrack program stimulates the process involved in doing an innovation business project in practice. The first skill that I hope to develop over the fastrack project of this course is teamwork. Teamwork is the crucial factor that determine the efficiency of the team. I also hope to develop my leadership skills and problem solving skills. We will face many problems and challenges in the project. Whenever a problem arise, we need to know how to find the solutions. Leadership skill is the one each individual member should develop, because we need to know how to lead a team to meet the goals and to make the team operating efficiently. 

I have studied a bachelor degree of commerce majoring in accounting and finance. The knowledge that I have learnt from the university and my one year working experiences in accounting firm have gained me the fundamental business knowledge which enable me to think different aspects of the problem arise from the project. I have successful complete one professional CPA module and a graduate certificate course while I was working full time last year. This experience helps me to develop the ability to work under pressure and to manage time effectively. I think these skills are valuable to the team.

There are many potential challenges arise through the fastrack program. I think the first challenge we may face is to understand each team member and to be familiar with them. Everyone member in the team may from different culture and education background and they all have their own ways of seeing things and ways of approaches. To work efficient in the team, we need to know each member’s strength. Then we may face challenge in unifying everyone’s idea. On the way to our project, we may have problems in meeting the objectives within scheduled. All these challenges will help us to develop our teamwork, leadership skill and problem solving skill.

I want to learn what the most important components of research are to determine whether an idea is truly feasible. I hope to learn what makes the difference between an idea and transforming it to a possible reality. I want to further develop the skills required to work in a diverse team in particular patience and trust. I look forward to developing skills in presentation - this include the visual presentation and how I present it verbally - and pitching, not only pitching an idea but pitching an idea with confidence. 
I believe skills I can contribute are the ability to critically analyse, think logically and see the big picture. Develop well thought out strategies.To think ahead and plan. From past experience I believe I am able to collaborate and work well as a team and I approach it with energy and see tasks through to the end.
Possible challenges I will learn from may include: over estimating my own ability to work in a team, different ideas or ways of approaching the task may challenge me to be more flexible and learn to negotiate with team members, certain stages in the process will seem unknown and ambiguous so I will be faced with the opportunity to learn how to deal with that. A huge challenge will be learning how to be productive in times of stress - when an idea that seemed fantastic isn't feasible, learning how to remain calm and approaching the task differently and with an open mind. There will be other challenges that are unforeseen so learning to be flexible is crucial. I am looking forward to learning how to best utilise each individual's strengths.

I want to learn further what differentiates the mediocre or good leaders from the great. I have read many books, I have looked up to mentors and even other role models whom have been able to lead others effectively – and have wondered what certain people have done or what they have experienced in order to shape them into great leaders. It mostly seems to me that the world needs brave creative leaders who inspire others, as well as more female leaders who really Lean In as Sheryl Sandberg puts it. 

I believe that leadership is a skill that can be learned, and that this seminar will help me discover the leader in myself. This seminar would be an invaluable opportunity, as I would be able to learn from business industry leaders and gain skills related to team building, networking, and more. There is no other class that offers this unique opportunity to gather insights and form our own blended approach to leadership.

As the program director at a non-profit organization in Canada, I had to lead and guide a team to support underprivileged children and their families. Through this experience, I learned to approach problems from different perspectives and appreciate the thoughts and values of my peers. This position also helped me gain insight into different backgrounds and cultures, allowing me to enhance my communication skills. Through my involvement with the Economics Student Association at the University of Ottawa in Canada, I was able to develop strong organizational and leadership skills. 

One of the biggest challenges I think I will face is working in a team - especially with people that come from different education backgrounds and cultural backgrounds. This experience will teach me how to effectively work with others that I normally might not work with as well as learning to be patient and to listen to other people's suggestions. I believe it will teach me to be more open and inclusive with others as well. Another challenge I believe this experience will bring is constantly making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes to develop an even better idea.

The skills I want to obtain:
Problem-solving skill: Firstly, I hope I can develop my problem-solving skill through this course especially to find the key ability to solve the real-world problems. Since I designed      my future career to hospitality industry, which is always related to different people and different situations, the problem-solving skill will become one of the most significant skills that I would mostly like to obtain. 
Innovation ability: Secondly, I also wish to learn the innovation ability due to the creation and innovation are the core elements of the organisation’s development. In my career plan, my final goal is being the general manager of a hotel, this would require me to have the capability to innovate as well as make the strategy.

2. The skills I can contribute: 
Interpersonal skill: I used to work in Grand Hyatt Melbourne as a guest relation officer thus I have learned a lot from the hotel industry about how to communicate with people effectively as well as how to motivate and inspire people. I do believe that I can use this skill to help my future team members to finish the teamwork within a cheerful working atmosphere.
Leadership skill: I believe teamwork is very important during this project and one of my strengths is organizing the whole team as well as allocating works to every team member, and make sure all of them are playing the right role I the team.

3. Potential challenges:
Teamwork will be one of the potential challenges even I think I have the ability to be a good team leader as well as allocating the jobs to right person. However, the reality is always unpredictable and different from the ideal situation. Due to my classmates are from different major and different countries. Thus when we make up to one team, the situation would be complicated because everyone has his own idea and plan. Furthermore, this course and project will directly face to the real-world business and organisations, therefore the theories might not match the reality. In other words, the assessment or project we have finished may not fix the real problems.

The second skill I am hoping to develop is the lean innovation cycle with the ideology of the 'rapid failure cycle' and failing often enough to succeed. I believe this is a fundamental element for a high performing team in this course as touching on my first point, idea generation comes from hard work, research and essentially trial and error. Once the team learns how to fail and understands processes, we will then be able to become a high performance team and achieve results from formulating ideas through productive and efficient techniques developed from our past experiences. Thirdly, I want to fully understand how to effectively manage the basic principals of performance improvement of a new team across different cultures with no history with each other. Most notably the four pillars. self, team, project and learning and understanding how to evaluate these topics as we go through the course by ensuring everyone including myself is on track, maintaining a common purpose, commitment, understanding and our overall plan and scope to achieve our objective.

My past skills and experience in both academic studies and work have brought strong teamwork and negotiation skills, critical thinking and evaluation techniques. These skills will contribute great value in particularly the process of the lean innovation cycle, assisting to generate ideas through the process, building the team to align common goals and plans and evaluating and constructively criticising ideas that may now be feasible or relevant to the task at hand. It will bring challenges of potentially having other feel negative towards my style and potentially have the group fall back to storming in the process.

Through the aspect of innovation I will broaden my thinking ability, allowing obtaining a holistic view on the subject matter and developing an out of the box solution. Even though the project hasn’t officially begun, but just after I read the client issues my observatory skills improved. Generally speaking I am not a good observer of my surroundings but after being introduced to the concept of this course I started observing and picking up potential problems which can be solved through an innovative idea. my thinking ability enhanced and brain stimulated. Furthermore, posting of my ideas on the idea zone, I had people comment and criticize. So just like I imagined, this course will and has to a certain extent helped me become open to the ideas of other people and take criticism constructively. I am optimistic that by the end of this course I will be able to put my limitations aside and be able to deliver my best individually and through my team. Lastly, I believe teamwork and innovation has a lot to do with patience, so I hope to develop my skill of patience as well. 

As far as the skills and experiences I can bring to the project are concerned, I’ll have to say that having worked with a consulting firm (for over 2 years now) with multiple clients and teams, I have developed the basic art of teamwork which I hope to polish through this course. During my experience as a professional I have worked with multiple teams to effectively deploy innovative projects and ideas. I have excellent communication, leadership, marketing and people management skills, which I believe will help my team move towards excellence. My strengths are effective planning, building coherent teams, and mitigation of risks.

Moreover, having ample experience in working with a team I am a strong believer of the fact that each team is different and each new experience will have new challenges. So as of now, the only challenges I foresee are the ones I have already experienced, like:

•	Define the working methodology
•	Plan effectively
•	Manage expectations
•	Assign roles
•	Understand the new team members
•	Conflict between team members",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

My team is definetly great and interactive. Our ideas may be different, but we exchange point of views and discuss everything thoroughly and constructively.
We will join up our efforts as well as our different mentalities into developing a successful and profound project. We come from different backgrounds and I think that this is a plus since we approach the various issues differently, which gives us a wider scope of things and generates a lot of options to getting the job done on time.",,,,,,,,

Our lead facilitator, Nikki introduced us to the innovation methodology used in the program, called the ‘lean innovation cycle’. One of the main skills I want to take away from this challenge is to learn this methodology and be able to repeat this innovation cycle on any scenario in the future. I am interested in finding out how an innovative idea can be transformed into a feasible real world business model and this methodology seems to be a successful way of achieving this. 
From the aspect of developing teamwork skills, Nikki and Philipp both indicated that working in teams of people with dissimilarities is a challenge faced all the time, in the real world. Therefore, I want the experience of finding out what the most effective and efficient way is, to look past these differences and get the job at hand done.
I believe the experience I have from my Ericsson HBBTV project from last year is advantageous for me. I was able to exercise my innovating skills when we were asked to ideate use-cases for a new TV technology. I was able to understand the importance of learning through failing when our client rejected use-cases that were of no interest to them. Furthermore, I have the know-how of dealing with a freeloader and taking the necessary action to fix the issue.
Potential challenges that I expect would be from working with a large team. From Nikki’s teamwork activity I realised that my team failed the task by not fully reading the instructions and by not communicating a plan before diving into the task. I believe the reason behind this was the lack of communication between members. From this I learnt, with large teams, internal communication is key.

Having to think of solutions to the different challenges we've been presented with will give me the ability to think of different solutions in a larger scale and grow my problem-solving abilities. I believe working in a team to tackle those challenges will also help me develop these skills because my thought process will be broadened as well as learning to deal with different people from different backgrounds.
I especially believe that I will be able to grow my leadership skills because when working with a new group of people, you can't be too sure of what abilities everyone has to bring to the table therefore someone has to take responsibility for assigning and delegating tasks and setting deadlines.
I have good presentation skills, leadership skills and an ability to work under pressure which I believe will be valuable to my team during this project. I think that having lived in Kenya, a third world country for most of my life has given me insight on how to improve systems using a low budget or very little access to information. 
I also did an internship in marketing before coming to study and I believe that experience taught me how to sell an idea or a product to a company very well.
Lastly, I think there were will be several issues arising from team members feeling that they had good ideas that weren't taken into consideration or time not being fully utilized. I think the lessons I will be able to pick from these are ways to make everyone in a team feel included and appreciated and to not waste any time from the moment the teams are chosen.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Also, I would like to develop the leadership skills as well as the team spirit through this course.  Meanwhile, it is also important for me to improve the communication skill with team members from various background. Such diverse interaction and global collaboration with classmates from all over the world will help me to understand other countries’ culture and think issues from different perspectives.
I obtained my Bachelor of Commerce degree in the University of Sydney. After graduation, I went back to China and worked at Ernst & Young Advisory department at Beijing for two years. Through my study and working experience, I have developed strong analytical skills in areas such as financial accounting and business management consulting. In addition, I am an Associate Member of CPA Australia (i.e. passed 5 out 6 subjects). I believe my accounting knowledge and professional experience will help the team to conduct in-depth research and select the effective solution to address the Client’s challenge in this project. 
I suppose the challenges in this project may arise as how to formulate the innovative concept to solve the client’s challenge and how to evaluate whether the selected idea is viable in actual business context. As a group of international students, teammates may have different opinions on whether certain solution is reasonable given their knowledge and experience. Therefore, we have to learn to cooperate with each other and establish efficient communication channels within the group to let everyone present and discuss the ideas and problems. Through such mode of learning, I can practise and improve the critical thinking ability and interpersonal skills which are essential for future career development.

During our first class of Teamwork and Innovation my group received an assignment and one of my teammates, who already has teamwork experience, immediately and clearly read to everyone what was required by it. All the team members felt positive and comfortable with the assignment and ready to work on it without any misunderstanding. I consider this experience a lesson because I have directly experienced the first steps of how to work within a team efficiently and effectively. I’ve learnt that starting off on the right foot is essential.
I would also improve my public speaking skills because I think it’s a core one for a manager. When you are speaking in public if you talk clearly, straight to the point and use the right words, you will definitely leave an important mark on the public. After a remarkable speech, people are inclined to perceive the speaker as a leader in their field. 
The best challenge that I hope to engage over the course of this experience is competing against more skilled teams than mine, because if you want to be the best you have to beat the best. I believe that learn it from a direct experience can become a useful hard skill for future challenges. Some years ago, I was in a team that had to challenge the most skilled team in a sport competition. All the team members were feeling insecure about the final result, so a few hours before the beginning I told them a short but inspirational message: “we can win if we just focus on performing our best”. Every team member started to focus more, and was ready to give the best. The opponent was stronger than us but other factors such as high motivation to achieve influenced our performance. I had the opportunity to demonstrate high performance and they simply followed the example. We won and we are still proud of ourselves. If you know how to motivate people, you must utilize this skill. a skill I strive to employ in my team. 
Before this course I had never composed an official business proposal. To express the business proposal in a professional way and be persuasive will increase the opportunity to receive positive feedback. It will be useful for me to comprehend the guidelines, realize it and see the final result. Certainly in the future I’ll feel more confortable with this kind of work.
Creativity and innovation together can make the difference. My family owns a specialized grocery shop. A few years ago I was contemplating how to develop it. The specialized grocery shops are not really common so I realized that a lot of people don’t have direct access to those kinds of shops. Globalization and technology made it possible to do business without physical presence. I decided to be innovative, utilizing e-commerce as an additional seals channel, discovering an open-source software in order to reach more customers from everywhere. Sales have been increased through the adoption of this innovation. Creativity starts inside our minds, but a pro-active approach of searching and catching information from all around us, assists us in adopting an innovative approach. Through creativity we ascertain solutions. This is something I wish to ingrain in the minds of my teammates, before we begin working. 
I’m sure it will be a highly educational course that will give us the opportunity to share our strengths and weaknesses, learn from each other, use our innovation and develop the necessary skills to be successful in a teamwork context.

Right now I use an analytical, accurate and logical approach according to some tests and reflection and I need to be more creative and flexible when it comes down to teamwork. And especially since you cannot plan everything ahead of time when you are working on a new innovation. There may be a need to change in a later stage and usually i'm not really good with uncertainty. So I hope to develop the skills to work in a team that is not structured from the beginning and be flexible in a team. The experiences I already have though is that I did a board year back in the Netherlands for an honours association. This helped me being able to make decisions in a group in a democratic way, but since everyone did have their own responsibilities and could take the lead on them, this challenge is gonna be a bit different. Furthermore, I did an exchange to the States before and had to work with americans so I have some experience with working with people from different backgrounds but never this many different backgrounds. I could really develop some skills in overcoming cultural differences with this course. Finally, I am good at tweaking ideas and actually implement them but the coming up with ideas is a step that I am not really good at. Since we have to work with Ideazone and come up with an idea as a team, this could be developed as well.

Communication skill is essential with a team. It helps to convey your ideas correctly and to perceive others’ precisely. Most importantly, with proper communication, every team member understands the objectives correctly via communication. For me it’s not easy to communicate in a second language, especially in a working circumstance. I hope to adapt our team quickly and communicate in an efficient way. When communication skill becomes my gadget, I hope to develop it into networking skill. Networking not just communicates in a work manner, but rather in a social way. Coordinator, project stakeholder or other parts in this experience might be a resource for further projects. Therefore, when you learn how to communicate with these people, you know how to deal with them on future projects. Apart from communication and networking skills, I hope to develop my leadership skill as well. I’m not comfortable with taking things in charge. However, when you move up in a position, it means more responsibilities and more decisions to make. I believe leadership skill leads a team member to become a team manager.

From my past experience in team projects, I know how to collaborate. Argument about deciding which strategy a team should use often happens because members are from different backgrounds. In my last team project, I encouraged every member to say out their thoughts. When we agreed on a common strategy, we communicate freely. It’s also important to identify tasks in a logical manner. This can be done by arranging regular meetings. I can be a reminder of which progression we are now. Once last task is cleared, we can move to another. I hope to contribute my collaborate skill and improve it over this experience.

First of all with the different cultures working together I would want to get a better feeling of how to treat people from other cultures like Asia inside a team. Also I want to experience how to work with different personalities inside a team. Like how to get a introverted person to step up with their ideas or how to stop a dominant person from pressuring their ideas on everybody. That means I want to develop my teamwork and leadership skills. I would also want to get better at motivating me and my teammates to get the best out of ourselves and how to solve conflicts in our team fast and long lasting. That means to encourage everybody to keep on working on good ideas even if the last ""great"" one failed and we have to start from the beginning. 
Now concerning the innovation experience I want to develop my skills in putting ideas to paper and developing them into a concrete business proposition. That would enable me later to formulate my own ideas and give me the possibility to work on own projects or business plans. The next skill which I really would love to improve is the work with clients. How to communicate with them, to present them ideas or just use them as a source of input for the project. That probably would help me a lot for my future because I think this is actually an important part of a lot of jobs. That would implicate developing a feeling for client wishes and thoughts in order to offer them the ideas and models that suit them best. 
The things I can contribute to this project are first of all a strong entrepreneurial mindset since my parents started their own company when I was a child. This experience offered me a broad inside view of a company and the problems they face which might give our team a better understanding of values for a company. I am also able to solve problems under pressure and I get really creative trying to reach my goals. Furthermore I could offer my team a broad knowledge of a lot of topics since I love reading books and news. That would enable us to implement some new trends into our ideas. Besides that I am a very positive person that always tries to motivate other people. I don't know if that is a skill but I think it is a big plus for the team climate especially during failure or hard times.

At the same time I would like the opportunity to enhance my ability to work well within a team and effectively manage tasks in a timely manner. Through this process I would like the opportunity for myself and the team to grow both personally and professionally. 

During my undergraduate degree I worked on two management consulting projects. These were run as intensive selective subjects from The University of Melbourne. One of these was conducted in Mumbai, India and the other was conducted locally in Melbourne. From both these experiences I was able to improve my communication, presentation and time management skills. It also gave me the opportunity to work within a team to deliver an outcome to a client. It was also important in the overseas project to be adaptable. We were working in a new working environment in an organisation that had a different working culture. 

During my undergraduate degree I also worked part time at Keech Australia. Keech has been designing and manufacturing steel castings for various industries for the past 80 years. Working at their innovation centre as a design assistant I was able to work alongside engineers and design new innovative products. This experience gave me insight into the development process for a new product and the challenges that come with designing a product that is highly customised.

Completing this fastrack programme comes with its own challenges. The first challenge will be to innovate a product or solution that is practical and solves a current problem or issue. This will require in depth research and possibly going back and forth from developing an idea to actually implementing that idea. Another challenge will be to collaborate as a team from the beginning and building up the relationship in the team so that each team member can work efficiently and put their best ideas forward.

I always feel embarrassed in front of people, and too shy to talk to strangers. What’s more, I do not know how to persuade, but I think convincing people is an important skill that I should learn, Secondly, I hope to build my leadership. In my mind, leadership is an ability of getting every team member involved in common projects and he/she should delegate different tasks to different members, the arrangement should be rational and applicable, and the leader also need to support members making contributions to the corporate goal. Thirdly, I wish to develop my ability of practice. I learned theories from books, but I do not think theories learning is enough. It is more difficult to implement a real project than just discussing a theory.

What I can contribute to this project is time management. I used to list all the things that I need to finish in a certain time for my daily life. First of all, I find out the most important and the most complicated things, marking them as priorities. Then, I put the easiest and less important thing at the bottom of the list. Because the good time management, I always complete my tasks and assignments on time. What’s more, I am a creative person, and I have many ideas. Thanks to the liberal arts education of my undergraduate school, I am good at critical thinking, and I can bring this skill to my team.

There are three potential challenges that I think will arise over the course of this experience. The first one is that, team members do not know each other very well, so it is difficult to make a decision who would be our team leader, and also be difficult to delegate tasks for members in a short time. The second one is, for the innovation activities, members have different ideas and opinions. therefore, it’s hard for the whole team to come to an agreement. The last one, is how to persuade other group members to help us for completing our group's task.

Though I managed several projects in the past which included teamwork, leadership and creative thinking I never had a start up like atmosphere where any idea could be possible. This will be especially challenging for a team as everyone has their own mind and think completely different. This requires to be a very good team player which skill I am hoping to improve. I am also hoping to improve my structured thinking which is also a vital part as the funnel from various crazy ideas to a complete structured business plan is huge and requires a lot of attention to detail and what is important and what is not.
Throughout my work experiences, sports and travels around the world I have gained various skills which will make an impact on my future team. Being responsible of organizing events such as for BMW which included a fleet of over 60 cars and customers of 200 people, teaching people how to ski and being a house captain in school gave me great leadership skills. This will be helpful as experience in group work is vital to have a good start. Playing sports such as Hockey, Football and Rugby, working in teams during various internships made me to very good team player which will be an enrichment to the Fastrack team.
One of the main challenges will be time management. As a team it is important to function and get things done on time. It is important to learn that there might be someone in the team that could do a part better, so outsourcing parts and therefore be more effective will be a challenge. Also noticing who needs help will be challenging, the work needs to be done as a team and not from a single person.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

For me, the most important skill would be problem solving skills. Take an example, The New South Wales government has already spent lots of time and money on sydney transportation system. It still needs improvement. As I know, there will be a light rail between circular quay and kingsford and the proposal faces many challenges when implement. Therefore it is crucial for me to have the ability to put my project into practice and problem solving ability will help me a lot. Another skill that I hope to develop is critical thinking skill. Problem solving skills need critical thinking to support, it can provide different ways and aspects to analyse and solve problems.
I have taken several business projects during my undergraduate. I learn how to do teamwork from the experiences. Different people have different ways of thinking and different characters. It is really hard to achieve a balance among voices and ideas. To solve the problem, team members can set up a goal together first and then all the decisions can follow the goal. Time management is also a chanllage for teamwork sometimes, since members may confuse their responsibility and rely too much on others. It is important to allocate tasks and makes sure everyone in the group in charge of some part.
Cultural differences can be a great chanllage for me. We come from different backgrounds and cultures, even a gesture can have different meanings. I tend to be very careful when talk with foreigners and it is hard for me to know what they are thinging about. The reality is that, in order to work efficiently in the group, each team member will have to share their thoughts and react within. I believe I can learn from this chanllage and this will help me a lot in the future.

At the end of this course i want to understand the entire process of a start up, how to access the potential of ideas and also how to persuade people to believe in my idea. Furthermore, i want to gain skills to build and maintain a strong client relationship. Moreover, a essential skill i want to learn is also to handle failure, to keep myself motivated during this process, and to learn and grow from mistakes.

Due to my work for he Formula One Mercedes Team, i could already gain experience in working in a ""one team, one dream"" environment. I learnt that every single person in a team is important and the outcome of a project is dependent on how a team interacts cause everyone is part of either success or failure. Communication and motivation are essential, which is not always easy when working with different personalities and cultures. Furthermore i have worked in many group projects during my undergraduate and was able to work to improve time and people management skills.   

One main challenge i see is first of all to find a project everyone is equally glowing for due to people differing in opinions and considerations. In addition, developing a strategic plan and working on a project efficiently due to the very different schedules every team member has.
It will be very interesting to see how a group interacts and motivates themselves after spending hours of work on a potential idea that then turns out to be a failure. A major challenge will be working with different personalities and cultures, different leadership and working styles, without anyone feeling misunderstood or not respected. I am more than confident that all this challenges will help me develop and improve the above mentioned skills i want to gain to build a basis for my future career when working on a project.
 This project will push my limits, give me confidence that i am able to think out of the box and furthermore maybe help me to discover the entrepreneur in me.

Furthermore, I am bringing leadership experiences to the project, which I have so far demonstrated by being a former course representative during my undergraduate studies as well as being currently the head of corporate relations and alumni within the CEMS Club Sydney community. 
In addition, I have a passion for small details, which can also be seen as a valuable skill, which I can contribute to the project work (skill developed and enhanced through past internships in form of preparing top management analyses and presentations presented to the board level of multinational corporations).

So what skills am I hoping to develop from this experience? I am quite sure that this experience will be very new and daunting for most of the students, as many have not had project or client-related experiences in a real business environment. However, I am particularly keen on learning more about intrapreneurship itself, but I also believe that innovation within a company (the bigger the company, the harder to implement innovation) can be very challenging as there are so many stakeholders involved, complicating all the steps in the innovation process. A skill, which I thus want to further develop is, persistency – “pushing” the right buttons within the company and as a result, achieve the implementation of that idea.
Another skill I hope to develop is clear communication within a team as I have experienced in the past that teamwork (especially if the team is so international) can be incredibly inefficient if, for instance, roles and responsibilities are not clearly allocated and communicated as well as what expectations the team has of itself and how to achieve its overall goals. Because what I have learned really is that one cannot assume that everyone else on the team has the same quality standards and working mentality as oneself and as a result, communicating these aspects as clearly as possible will improve the overall performance of the team.

I also can imagine that this particular innovation project will push me to my personal limits and out of my comfort zone in terms of re-creating and re-adapting the idea over and over again as innovation is a process and not a status quo. I am generally a person who likes structure and is well-organised but with this I expect that this project can truly challenged my usual way of working.

Through this program I hope to improve my personal soft skills in 3 ways: communication, cooperation and coordination. In the progress of a team’s internal co-working, communication skill is absolutely the most important thing. Cooperation and coordination are also indispensable parts of a team. Good communication skills can coordinate team members well and lead to good team cooperation. I want to learn how to negotiate by talking to getting agreements in the end as well as balance the needs among people from different cultural environment. 
2.	I have 2 internship experiences before. The one in financial department taught me the importance of accuracy and expertise. The other one in human resource department taught me the skills of plan making and time managing. Both experiences require me to be a patient and hardworking team member and that’s the basic part I can contribute to this project. Besides, I think I can also provide ideas, so do the specific program skills that might be used in the project. As long as it is useful to our work, I am willing to learn and try anything.
3.	I think the biggest challenge it might bring is to working in a cross-cultural environment. However, it also can be a great chance to gain experience from working with people came from different cultures. On the one hand, we might be hard to achieve agreements while making a team decision. On the other hand, it means that we all need to communicate as much as we can with each other inside the team. We might run into many problems but we might be able to make a big improvement as well. It is also a good opportunity to learn from others. Any thoughts from different angles can be an inspiration to the whole team.

As I am very communicative in general, in need of harmony and soothing when needed, I am a good listener and arbitrator to keep the harmony and work going. Besides that, I tend to stay strong even in difficult situations and encourage the team to stay on path.
Besides these soft skills, I am very structured, organized and analytical.
I think the fastrack brings many challenges. First of all, a team with members from different cultural backgrounds will be challenging. Different habits, attitudes and opinions will be challenging but a good opportunity to learn from. Working under time pressure, a possible setback or frustrating situations will be challenging as well. However, every above mentioned aspect has a good side: It makes you stronger.

I do not mind whether it is a new language, a sport, a new recipe, or a new way of doing something. However, the most valuable lessons are those you learn about yourself. The difficult thing I find, is that you mainly learn things about yourself from other people. And this is where it gets complicated: people are not like mirrors. They are harder to read. That is why I have learned that you should always ask for feedback.

In the past, I have done many activities that involve teamwork, hence I have had many opportunities to learn about myself. This brought me some insights about things that I am good at, even though at first I thought it was really hard to admit being good at certain things. When I was studying in Amsterdam, I was always on the board of all kinds of clubs and societies: an association for international students, my sorority, and the largest student association in Amsterdam with over 2500 active members. I always enjoyed being in a team and organizing activities for my fellow students, allowing them to develop themselves. Preparing for a big event, reaching a target, and seeing everyone leaving with a smile on their faces gave me energy. Being responsible for something substantial or a challenging target and motivating other people to help, and to make a difference together, makes me feel fulfilled. At the end of every team project, I asked what other people considered to be my strong or weak points. I am happy that until now, what makes me feel good are the same skills that other people consider to be my strengths.

This being said, I have experienced that I still have many learning points. Being enthusiastic about many things, pro-active, and positive-minded, intensive before-hand research is not my strong point. I tend to work on projects in a lean way, adapting as we go. I am a flexible person, and change does not bother me. However, I have learned that some people like to reflect and think things through first and act later. This research based approach is something I would like to learn in the future, and hopefully over the course of this experience already.  Also, I still sometimes struggle when it comes to presenting. I am not always confident enough to stand in front of a big group and present by myself. I guess it is like with learning all new skills: just do it and ask for people's tips along the way.

I am really looking forward to this course and I hope I can develop my weak points, learn from others and maybe help out others over the next few weeks.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Also, I want to improve my problem solving skills and raise my self confidence in working environment. When I studied bachelor’s degree in Australia, I experienced teamwork with people from diverse background. I felt uncomfortable to share my ideas. Although I had an idea, I couldn’t express it in professional way to persuade other team members. I experienced this several times and this experience made me less confident to work as a team. I was determined to develop my skills and perform better in the future teamwork experience. This is the time to practice and develop my communication skills and professional thoughts in this teamwork and innovation course. I have really strong individual responsibility and accountability. Also, I’m very supportive person when I work as a team. When there team members experiencing difficulties, I willing to help them. Once the task allocated, I don’t want to leave it until the end so I always finish my tasks very efficiently. Many of team members had difficulties on researching and I helped them with researching when we worked on a project. Moreover, I had a chance to learn at researching course at my undergraduate degree. My researching skills and responsiveness and accountability will contribute to the project of this course to be effective and efficient. However, I consider that there will be a challenge for me to develop my thought more mature and professional in limited time to have enough communication between team members. We need to get as much as ideas from each people during that stage we might have some conflict. In this course, all of the members are from different culture. Promoting unity and managing conflict in such a short term is challengeable for the team.

We are provided with a recipe, yet the quantity and types of ingredients are up to our interpretation. We are provided with a method, yet the instructions are in no particular order and are susceptible to change at any time. We are provided with a purpose for the cake, yet the final product remains unclear. To say that I'm hoping to become the next Bill Gates by the end of 13 weeks would be rather irrational, however, I believe the DeloitteFastrack program provides a great opportunity for me to: 
a) enhance complex business problem-solving skills within a diverse international team
b) understand how consulting and innovation is applied in real-life business contexts
c) spark creativity through social interactions and networking opportunities with like-minded innovators 

Although my experiences in baking a cake are rather limited, I have developed several skills in previous experiences which can contribute to this project. From conducting a musically illiterate choir as House Music Captain during school and liaising with Thai students and diplomats as the President of the University of Sydney Thai Students Association, to integrating Taylor Swift lyrics into an English phonics program at a rural village school in Thailand and working on social development issues at the OECD headquarters in Paris, I recognise that leadership characteristics are essential, and I enjoy the opportunity to lead as much as being a team player. I have been able to deploy the skills developed outside the classroom to balance my academic and professional performances with extra-curricular activities and I encourage all my colleagues to adapt a similar mindset towards life in order to remain calm and focused in stressful situations, especially within a workplace context. 

Like most things in life, the unpredictability of challenges faced when baking a cake can occur at any time. From power outages and broken egg timers to accidents involving knives and blenders, a baker must learn to adapt and continue baking, regardless of changing circumstances. The challenges which may arise throughout this program might include minor issues such as miscommunication, misalignment of priorities or perhaps contrasting work styles, however, if left unaddressed, these 'minor' factors may evolve into more serious problems such as unequal distribution of work load, the lack of formal decision-making and continuous encounters with roadblocks. From these challenges, I believe that we can learn the true value of teamwork and collaboration, the importance of being open minded towards individuals from different backgrounds, as well as the ability to persevere and never give up, even when it feels like we've reached 2394820398 dead ends. Although only one team can win, it is the journey of sprinting and overcoming hurdles along the fastrack, which will be the core learning experience for all of us in this program.

In particular, being involved in a project such as the Fastrack Challenge will require active listening of group members’ component ideas and an ongoing opinion exchange process. Through these two activities I hope to enhance my interpersonal skills in order to be prepared for effective communication in the work environment. I consider this work-integrated learning as a training foundation for my future, an opportunity to interact and co-operate on a micro-scale. During this new experience, I expect to empower the self-awareness of my strengths and weaknesses, and I believe this represents the first step to building a successful team and the milestone to carry out a project effectively and efficiently. 
Looking back on my previous studies, I can still feel the frustration of not getting things done in the proper manner, the difficulties encountered when social loafing or free riding phenomena occurs. 
When my group work appeared to be less than the sum of its components’ work, instead of more, I started asking myself: “How do I get people more involved and interested?” “How should I handle this?”
When you find yourself in such a situation, that’s the point where you start enhancing your maturity, your coaching skills and your interpersonal skills. 
Working in a team has been sometimes one of the hardest things I have ever experienced. Sharing conflicting ideas, talking with someone who might disagree on what you think is right or wrong, exchanging different perspectives might be hard especially when you are approaching with people coming from different backgrounds and cultures. However, even if this is challenging, it represents the most rewarding experience I have ever had. 
An African proverb says: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”.
My university experience revealed to me how much you can benefit from the value-added generated by a teamwork situation not only in terms of the concrete knowledge you get but also in terms of personal improvements. 
The thirteen group working weeks, in which we will be involved, will bring about conflicting ideas and the pressing need to have our own thoughts and directions listened and followed. 
Communication and flexibility will be the key to work successfully as a group. Indeed, sharing our perspectives and explaining the reasons why we think that way, might be a good way for the other people to understand our point of view. Furthermore, flexibility could be a good ally to overcome the common “my-way-is-the-best-way” problem. Finally, different problem solving methods will arise due to the heterogeneous composition of the class. In this regard, it will be necessary to transform the initial cultural and background differences to our strength and utilise it in a manner that will be useful and enable high performance of the team.

First of all, I am hoping to develop my self reflection and feedback skills. Within the Fastrack Challenge, we will closely work together with a professional from Deloitte. The idea might seem perfect for my team, however might not make much sense to the stakeholders involved. Therefore, I want to be able to critically asses my ideas as well as my groups ideas in a wider scope. It is obviously hard to accept critique, but I am more than keen to develop these skills.

Secondly, I have gained team work experience which can greatly contribute to this project. During my undergraduate, we at least had 4 group work projects per semester. These presented a wide range of real company challenges but also a formation of a real company in year two. I have also been in leading positions in these teams, therefore I believe this is an asset. Furthermore, my intercultural background and cultural awareness also contribute to this project. I have lived and studied in different countries, and I am very aware of different working styles in different areas of the world.

Finally, my already existing team work skills, could bring challenges to the group, as not everybody might have similar experiences. This is closely connected to different views on time management and constant communication. Overall, I am very excited to be part of this project!",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Participating in Deloitte Fastrack Program is the first time that I get involving in strategic consulting project in the real world. Comparing with solving cases with fixed scenario in University, the dynamic environment and ripple effect among factors in society will train me to become a considerate person before making decision, and I would cherish this opportunity to develop a most feasible and effective proposal together with my group mates. 

Secondly, I would like to develop my strategic innovation skill. I understand that the development of this skill require insights of not only the challenge (case) itself, but also the external environment. The Fastrack Program will train me to view the issue from different angles and build a creative mind from practicality. 

Thirdly, I would like to develop my critique skill. Brain storming as a group would bring a number of interesting ideas regarding to the challenge. It is a good opportunity for me to develop critique skill by making detailed evaluation on each idea and find out the most feasible one.

Over the past three years, I participated in a variety of extra-curricular activities in addition to study. Acting as a founder, and thereafter the Vice-President of a newly established society, I gained experience in preparing paperwork, hosting Inaugural General Meeting, and further enhanced my communication skills in the registration process. Moreover, I was competitively selected as a participant of UCLA Summer Exchange Program, which further diversified my cultural background. Outside the university, I also acquired practical experience from internship and volunteer events. These kinds of experience improved my skills of communication, problem-solving, team-working as well as active learning. I believe that I could contribute these skills and experience to the project, sharing with my not only my group mates, but the entire class.

This is the first time that I try to solve a business problem in the real world outside the University, I believed that I could also learn a lot from the challenges of unexpected difficulties, both in the problem-solving and in team communication. In all, I am preparing myself for the challenges and trying to be a competent employee in consulting firms.

Just as important, I would aim to understand and learn of the elements necessary for a high performing team.

To fine tune more specific skills, I expect to learn of successful pitching techniques and the precision necessary in validating the idea beforehand . Naturally, during the overall process I expect to learn of the procedural framework in which to successfully implement and exploit ideas.


In regards to what I can bring to the program, I have in the past initiated a potential idea and carried it through to execution.  In my past leadership role, I have had experience in delegating task work and awarding roles in alignment with people’s passion and skills, in order to maximise the effectiveness of the group. For instance, I awarded a volunteer studying digital design a marketing role in which she could be creative and thus motivated in performing well.  I would seek however to build on such skills with more incremental goals and responsibility embedded in the Fastrack framework.

Furthermore, I have had some experience validifying potential business ideas and researching their feasibility. This can be demonstrated by my involvement in Enactus, when applying potential business ideas to solve certain social problems.  Once more, I would be keenly interested to learn of a more detailed method in which to validify potential business ideas.

I would foresee several potential challenges, one being collaborating with team members from diverse backgrounds to achieve a common purpose. I would predict for example, that there could be issues of quality, communication and implications from potential disputes. Simply miscommunication within the team, or failure to communicate effectively with mentors could facilitate inefficiency within the team and compromise common objectives. I think there is a great opportunity however to learn of tools which can circumvent these challenges and optimise team efforts in achieving a certain goal. 

Furthermore in validifying potential business ideas in the face of PESTLE environmental blockages.  Another may be encouraging the team to work productively after experiencing failure.

Especially concerning the teamwork part of it, I would like to learn how to handle difficult situations better and how to deal with upcoming interpersonal issues. While working in a team I would like to learn more about understanding the feelings of my team members better and react appropriately to their reactions. an efficient way of opinion exchange is equally important. Additionally having patience and trust in my team and finding a way to get to our goal together are what I hope to learn. Risk taking is a skill that I would like to develop during this project.
 To work together as an international team, from many different cultures will pose its diffiulties. But with good communication and finding a way of involving everybody by encouragement and exchanging of ideas those challenges should be solved. Another challenge could be the assignment of the team members to a task that suits their skillset best. It is vital to learn by communication who is good at which specific task and make sure they are happy and work well in this position.
I could contribute with my communication skills towards the project. In other projects during my Bachelors I tried to make sure that everyone felt heard, could express his or her thoughts and be actively involved in the decision-making. With my positive attitude I will try to motivate my team as much as possible.

Having worked in many international teams due to various exchanges, I am confident that I can contribute positively to our project. I am a diplomatic person and I am sensitive to people’s opinions. I like to take responsibility, but at the same time I do not mind stepping back when there are already too many alpha leaders in a team. I am a very thorough and accurate person, which can be a positive characteristic when there is enough time to complete a task. However, in times of time pressure it can be hard for me to understand which tasks can be disregarded, since I tend to get lost in detail sometimes. In order to guarantee a high standard, as a perfectionist, I often tend to do most of the work myself instead of delegating it to different team members. I hope I will learn to trust my team members and understand that it is vital for a team to distribute the different tasks so that everyone can contribute to the teamwork. 
I assume that during the Fastrack Innovation Challenge we will face many difficult situations that require a quick decision. This will be a challenge for me because I tend to be afraid of rush decision-making. I prosper in structured environments and like to work in a logical, accurate and planned manner. I am fully aware that we will face many chaotic and unstructured situations during the upcoming weeks, which is going to be a huge challenge for me since I am not used to working in such an environment. However, I am looking forward to overcome these challenges with the team and to grow as a person.

In one of my practicals, Me and my team had enforced practical solutions to increase the market presence of a company that is facing lack of brand image. This was achieved through analysing what the major problem was, and to create effective and creative solutions that stands out from other solutions. The challenges faced during this practical was to have creative solutions combined with practicality. This includes having appropriate budgets and a short time frame for implementation. As such, the solutions were frequently changed in order to achieve the ideal end result.

Prior to the orientation, I didn’t understand the extent to which this challenge is self and team driven. Instead, I expected it to be more structured and offer more guidance in the initial ideation phase. Coming into this challenge, I’ve just completed a unit where I consulted for a social enterprise in Vietnam and I’d gained valuable skills in driving a project, coming up with ideas for a company in a short amount of time and pitching these ideas to them. These were skills that I expected would place me in a good position for this challenge, and, despite the nerves, I still believe that they will prove helpful. 

The biggest challenge that I see in this programme is coming up with three business ideas. Whilst completing the first set of milestones gave some guidance, I still feel like I may struggle. However, as I think that I would like to work with innovative businesses in consulting, this is a skill that I will need to develop and the Fastrack Challenge will be the perfect environment in which to do so. 

In order to formulate ideas, I’m planning on playing to my strength in research. I’ve set aside time to further research Deloitte, Transport NSW and the five growth areas that Deloitte has identified. Another strength that I’m bringing into this challenge is my knowledge in marketing, which I believe will help with need or problem recognition and stages two and three of the Lean Innovation Cycle. I am concerned that a majority of usable ideas will be tech orientated, which is not a strength of mine. However, this could be a chance to fill that knowledge gap, and I’m hoping that once I’m placed in a group we’ll have different skills that will allow us to develop any viable idea.

More specifically, I hope I could be familiar with the Lean LaunchPad process and successfully apply it to the reality. I personally regard the stage of linking value proposition to customer segments as one of the most crucial part throughout the whole process and therefore hope to go deeper into that part. Moreover, I think it is a good opportunity to enhance my communication skills with professional business people such as our clients, mentors and team members, which will be extremely useful in my future career. Last but not least, I hope to practice my performance improvement skills during the course in order to deliver more consistently successful outcomes.

In terms of how to contribute myself, I am proud of my ability of research and data analysis that I have successfully managed to complete numbers of case analysis, both individually and in a group. Although I have strong logic when doing the analysis, I am also very enthusiastic, creative and always open-minded to new ideas. This helps me avoid getting stuck in conservative thoughts, which I reckon is exactly what this innovation project requires. I have a number of teamwork experiences and it is a fortune that I have always got along with my team members well without any unpleasant dispute. Consequently, I believe I can not only benefit a lot from the FASTRACT project, but also contribute to it.

There might be some challenges from value proposition to feasibility assessment, especially when we come up with numerous ideas but none of them seems to work after we go further, and I think it is even more challengeable in developing potential clients. However, I am sure our team will ultimately solve them together and do well.

As designed, FASTRACK is an experiential and work integrated learning with the objective of enabling students to improve work ready skills and providing them with practical experience and professional networks. The program offers participants theoretical innovation framework for intrapreneurs named ‘Lean LauchPad’ and a corresponding application of it to real client challenges such as key grow sectors of Australia including gas, agribusiness, tourism, international education and wealth management. Collective engagement with team members, industry mentors, clients and industry advisers is intrinsic to the program.

From that, I perceive this experience as a transition from a student to a practitioner. In specific, over the course of this experience, I expect the program to foster the development of my skills set including teamwork skills, knowledge utilization and application regarding innovation, professional communication and performance improvement skills. 

Firstly, unlike the collaborative studying environment at university where team work skills are developed via group assignments in which team members have similar specialist background such as finance or marketing with the same timetable, in this experience, a team of students from different specializations with varied schedules would give more chances for the improvement of how to fully and properly utilize the team members given their knowledge, skills set and capabilities. Moreover, varied schedules require an effective team working process and a higher level of responsibility from each individual. In addition, I expect the program to provide a logical and research-based approach to team work. 

Secondly, as far as I am concerned, one of the desirable attributes employers seek from graduates entering their organizations is the capacity to have a ‘can-do’ attitude, to be ‘innovative’ and to be the ‘new blood’ of the organization with fresh new ideas. I am also convinced that ‘innovation’ is not completely an innate ability, it can be learned and developed over time. Therefore, the theoretical innovation framework and the real business-based challenges of the program would form and then sharpen my innovation skills. With high expectation, I could learn by doing and learn how to fail faster, fail cheaper and fail often enough to succeed. 

Thirdly, I believe there would be a shift in communication skills from semi-professional to professional. In particular, at university, communication skills are normally enhanced via student-to-student and student-to-lecturer conversations, lectures, written assignments and exams. All of them are normally academic and are assumed to have a reasonably equal understanding about a specific topic. Differently, in this program, the objects of communication are practitioners, professionals and real clients whose understanding might be varied in business world. How to effectively communicate with them requires more thoughts and practices.  

Finally, I highly expect the program to form a practice of reflection on my experience by giving theoretical framework and chances for carrying it out. Moreover, I am convinced that the potentialities of a person can be only developed fully by promoting his or her emotional intelligence (EI) including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. I hope to dramatically enhance these skills via a vast array of activities of collaborative and real engagement with real business people in the program. For instance, it appears to be interesting for me to observe how I will react to potentially awkward situations when dealing with clients and industry advisers for information collection. Furthermore, life-long and life-wide learning is supposed to be crucial to a person’s success. How to ‘learn to learn’ when leaving university is what I am seeking and it is also my expectation from the program.

In turn, the skills I have to contribute to the experience include team work skills and intercultural understanding, good understanding of business environment, well-prepared business communication and basic understanding and awareness of experiential learning. 

Firstly, apart from group assignments at university, my team work skills have been developed via the role of an exchange participant on a multi-cultural education project in Hungary through cooperating with an international team of 7 participants in teaching primary and high school students English, presenting each individual’s culture by teaching dancing, cooking and language. They have been also enhanced in the former role of a leader in a voluntary campaign for university students in Vietnam (Mua He Xanh campaign) through organizing and locating the campaign in remote provinces such as Binh Phuoc and Soc Trang with diverse activities like teaching orphans Maths, English and Literature, raising funds for a small local business providing financial advice. Therefore, I believe that I am capable of collaboratively working with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, it is interesting for me to figure out how I could promote my skills in a much more professional environment. 

Secondly, I possess excellent academic track record in finance and accounting and strong understanding about business environment in general. Excellent numerical and analytical skills have been continually enhanced at university through a number of quantitative and qualitative courses with outstanding marks (93% in Corporate Finance, 85% in Quantitative Finance, 90% in Quantitative Methods for Business and 86% of case analysis in Business Environment units). As a result, it is rewarding for me to discover how effectively I could utilize these knowledge as my strengths into a real business concept and how consistently and coherently I could match and combine them with other team member’s knowledge in order to reach a novel solution to a real client challenge. 

Thirdly, apart from social activities at university such as being a postgraduate mentor, I have been fully aware of the need for improving Business English as a commerce student. To fulfill my gap between Academic English and Business English, I attended the Business English program at Centre for English Teaching at The University of Sydney and then took a BULATS test from Cambridge University. I successfully achieved the highest level in reading, listening and writing and upper-intermediate level in speaking. The program and the certificate, therefore, should be a basic preparation for FASTRACK. It is exciting to see how well I could apply what I have learned. 

Finally, during my postgraduate study, I have been introduced to reflective writing. In fact, I often reflect on my studying at the end of each week by summarizing the lectures and figuring out the links between chapters within a unit and between different subjects in my specialization. It, therefore, would be not so uncomfortable for me to spend time writing and keeping a learning journal. However, in this experience, I am interested in expanding this practice in a larger scope.

Firstly, I hope to improve my ability of critical thinking. This program is innovative and informative, requiring critical thinking skills. Critical thinking is an important skill which is required in the competitive world. Thus, I would like to practice and perfect my ability to think critically. Secondly, I would like to enhance my ability of problem solving. The program requires us to act like a consultant for a particular business, to find out suitable and feasible solutions that may address the problems they are confronting. As working in an advisory firm is my first career choice in the near future, I hope my ability in this area would be elevated through practices in this program. Thirdly, I believe practice experience would be enriched. As the program uses the real life cases as our study material, I will have the opportunities to put theoretical knowledge into practical world. It is the most exciting experience I am expecting. After studying at Sydney University for nearly two years, I would like to gain some practical experience which would further benefit my future career. Last but not least, I hope my ability of collaboration could be improved as there are several assignments and practices need to be done by group. Collaboration is the topic of increasing consideration today, thus I would like to have good communication skills and cooperation skills. 

In terms of what I can contribute, my internship experience at Ernst & Young and my current ability of problem solving would be the answer. Although my internship in EY only lasted for a short period, I have gained some ideas about how the ‘big four’ are structured and how do they cooperate internally (within the company) and externally (with external institutes). The course of ‘social entrepreneurship’ I have taken previously also gave me some ideas about how to work with enterprises and find out feasible solutions that would suit their appetites. The problem solving skills I have practiced in that course may contribute to this program as well.

As a graduate, the capacity in the area of business innovation is necessary and would enable me to quickly get involved in the future career. Therefore, for me, the Deloitte Fastrack Program will be a good chance to experience how the real innovation works in the real organization. Compared with the empty talk in theory, the practice in a real business setting will impress me and enable me to feel the impact to a company brought by innovation. 
Through the past education and internship experiences, I have already obtained skills in critical learning, business communication, teamwork and etc. Critical thinking is the emphasis point for each course during the past 3 semesters spent in USYD, which I have already practised for many times. Business communication is the capacity acquired by communicating with the supervisor and colleagues in the past internship, such as the IPP program I participated in last summer. In addition, teamwork is also a personal skill that I already have through some projects and units. These capacities are able to assist me to contribute to the Fastrack program.

Firstly, I hope to develop communication skills. Since English is not my first language, I do not feel so confident when I communicate with locals. Thus, I hope to develop my communication skills during the process of team work. Since my major is accounting, I need to communicate with different person in my future career. I believe this skill is essential to me. 
        Secondly, I also hope to develop my creative thinking skills. I did many units which mainly focus on enhancing other skills such as critical thinking skills. For example, BUSS5000. According to the outline of this course, we need to come up with some creative business ideas. The creativity is the core competence in many companies. So I believe this skill is beneficial to me. 

2.	Firstly, I already have critical thinking skills, since I finished a unit mainly designed to develop our critical thinking skills. During that course, I knew how to analyse information. For example, we cannot readily believe the information from the newspapers. We need to do our own investigation before we have a conclusion. I think this skill will help me a lot in this course, because I need to analyse the business ideas of other team members. 
        Secondly, I already have active listening skills. I already finished a lot of units which contain group jobs in the structure. So I have the experience of working with different persons from diverse backgrounds. I know how to listen to others and respond to them. Since this is a course which needs students to communicate with others, I believe this is a helpful skill which can certainly contribute to my group. 

3.	I may encounter challenges during the communication with my team members. There may be some conflicts between team members. If I can successfully solve this problem, I believe it will become my precious experience. Since this is the final semester of my degree, the time management may be another issue. I think I can benefit from this experience if I can reasonably arrange my timetable.

Secondly, I want to get more practical skills as how to make an innovative idea actually work, which may contain lots of difficulties but I am looking forward to checking what the challenges are. Finally, I hope I could overcome my difficulties when making presentations in front of the audience that I may not be familiar with. 

In terms of the second question, the main two skills and experiences I already have that can contribute to this project are as follows. Firstly, I had a subject called 'Innovation and Entrepreneurship' in one of my Bachelor degrees, where we worked as a group to work out a blueprint for an innovative project created by ourselves. I learnt a lot from this experience, including how to think of a plan in a creative and practically feasible way, how to write an attractive proposal and present it to the potential investors and how to finance and forecast future financial statements. Also, I finished double majors in Accounting and Management in my bachelor degree and now I am doing my further studies on accounting and finance in my master degree, so i have done lots of research in those areas which might be helpful for our project.

-	Communication skills. In this project, a variety of discussion and negotiation with teammates as well as with clients will be made. I hope after this semester, I will know better on how to effective exchange ideas and make group decision. And also how to settle disagreement in group discussion.
-	Professionalism. Mentors from Deloitte will guide us on the installment of each innovative idea. I hope through our cooperation, I will gain more knowledge on how to behavior and talk as a professional person
-	
-	What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?
-	Time management. I have a volunteer consulting experience at a NGO in Nepal. In that program we helped to transition from a charity organization to social enterprise. Therefore, I know the basic procedure of coming up a detailed business plan and how to manage our work in time
-	Working with professionalism. Through internship in PwC, I know a bit of talking to clients and professional people. This may help a little to teamwork but I feel this challenges will be different since people we talk most seems to be the expert in industry. 


-	What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?
-	Interview and consultation with experts from industry. Firstly, it will be a bit of challenging that we will make code calls to person who might directly drop the phone after we stated who we are. This will definitely contribute my capability to take to a stranger and improve my networking ability. Secondly, I assume there will be a torturing time where we came up new ideas and the ideas be kicked out immediately after talking with experts and we have to go back and come up with new one.  I guess after several times’ rejection, when thinking of a new idea, we will consider in a more practical way than before.

This course can provide me an access to the broader business community, and from my prospective, Deloitte’s innovation community will help me to develop 4 areas of skills, which are self, team, project and learning. And it will prepare me better for ‘business of tomorrow’. 
Specifically, through this course, I want to develop my time management, structured problem solving, and teamwork skills. Also, I want to develop an effective and efficient way for me to innovate, as well as presentation skills, research, project management, entrepreneurship concepts.
What’s more, I enjoy the risk detecting aspect of audit and problem solving of consulting, which require analytical, critical and innovational thinking to reach a solution. Therefore, I believe this program will be well rewarding, and I will become more proactive, positive and self-motivated.

Skills I already have are that time ""four quadrant"" method, which divide my work according to the importance and urgency of two different degrees. independent research, knowledge sharing and note taking while reading or discussing.
Meanwhile, taking initiative is one of the most important strategies to learn more in this programme, for it promotes communications.
3 
Potential challenges I think will arise over the course and I can learn from is the importance of respect and consideration, as well as time management. I guess short of time will be the biggest challenge.

2. Profession. By mentored and working with Deloitte people, I can prepare to be more professional for the future works. 
3. A better understanding of Deloitte. From this course, I desire to get a better understanding of Deloitte. Such as what services it provides, what corporate culture it cultivates, and the work-life balance of Deloitte people.

The skills that I can contribute to both this course and our group are: 1.I have a high level of education from quality institutions in China, Japan and Australia. The studying and working experiences in these countries equipped me a cross-cultural sensitiveness and adaptions. I am confident in communicating people from different background and therefore, improve the collaboration among our team.

On the professional development level, it is important not only to understand the procedure and timeline of developing a new product but also the various considerations one must take into account to ensure its sustainability and, ultimately, how it can give value to customers and return a profit for the company. Further, I value achieving outcomes through a collaborative effort and through consulting with leaders in their respective fields. This level of business communication is crucial to being an effective business practitioner. Thus, I would hope to develop stronger communication and technical skills, in a business context, with the aim of implementing these skills to enhance to further my business career. 

Through my experience as a solicitor at a commercial law firm, I can contribute to the project from a legal standpoint. Specifically, I practice in commercial litigation, leasing, sale and purchase of businesses, and general business law. I have experience in reviewing contracts, ensuring compliance with regulations and contract terms as well as dealing with disputes. I believe legal skills would be valuable to the team as agreements and various legal documentation are required in the set up and delivery of any product. As a legal practitioner, I have developed an aptitude for critical thinking, identifying key issues, processing bundles of information under time pressures, solving problems and delivering clear advice to achieve effective solutions. 

Further, through my leadership and promotional roles in student services and the marketing unit respectively at University of Technology, Sydney, I have developed strong interpersonal and teamwork skills. As marketing is a crucial component to developing a new product, I hope to draw upon these experiences to work effectively with my supervisors, mentors and colleagues to create a clear value proposition, marketing strategy and to deliver key messages to customers.

I anticipate that the first challenge would be the generation of useful ideas that present an opportunity to the market and creates value to potential customers. As I have little experience in the innovation and business consulting industry, I have limited capacity in drawing upon necessary knowledge to create a structured business proposal or plan as well as the lack of exposure to pitch a new idea to investors. As this is an essential process in product development, I am keen to gain insight in this industry and learn methods to implement business models to evaluate ideas. 

Once an idea is chosen, I anticipate that the coordination of the correct steps to follow would be a challenge. I have limited experience in project management but I feel it is fundamental to create an overall outline, prioritise issues and considerations and to allocate specific tasks to team members to work on in a logical manner. I plan on building strong rapport with my team members to overcome this challenge and implement a system that creates a positive and inspirational environment. 

Ultimately I am eager to learn about the intricacies of business development of innovative products and to enhance my capabilities. I endeavour to use my skills to make a significant contribution to the project.

To carry on this project efficiently and effectively, I think I am self-motivated and goal-oriented person. I can manage my time well and I am not a procrastinator. When tackling a problem, I will analyse it deeply and do a critical thinking, which includes identify, analyse, evaluate and explain. Based on my first experience of group assignment in Sydney uni, I learnt a lot, that is, you can not treat yourself as a leader mainly because you are more familiar with the knowledge involved than others, sometimes, the leader is the one that can find every team members' strength and coordinate them for the only purpose.

Because the content and the practice of the course are helpful to inspire participants to think local, think global, think different and think outside the box. The methods chosen by this course are innovative to combine the academic study and corporation practice, online self-learning and in-person communicating. With the goal of achieving innovative assignments and actively taking a part in activities, we have to explore our potentials of creating new ideas and new solutions. During this process, others' thoughts could wide our horizons and stimulate each other to think over different angles.

Secondly, I am looking forward to have the firsthand experience on communicating and leadership skills. Although maybe I am not the leader of a group, I can observe how a great leader to settle the argument between members and achieve an agreement under conflicting discussion. At the same time, maybe I could have an opportunity to experience a leader's inappropriate reactions when facing the difficulties. 

During my past experiences, I can contribute my cooperation skills. Because I need to provide and collect creative contents with other colleagues when I worked as an editor for faculty magazine. I tried to balance different opinions and guide the discussions under the directions. Besides, I made efforts to reach an agreement on cover design and formats by representing the advantages of different plans and offering tutors' opinions rather than simply voting.

On the other hand, I gained the wide range of knowledge during my university study and internship. My study covers the areas of professional accounting, business theory, economics, philosophy, psychology and culture. With the know-how, I can create ideas from many fields and think on different sides.

Among the potential challenges I could face over this course, I think the biggest one is the team working. Unlike other courses, this course required participants more teamwork instead of only one or two group assignments. It required us to build a friendly atmosphere, conduct effective communications and tacit cooperation in a short time.

I am also a good team player and I am aware of the importance of sharing ideas with colleagues, and functioning as a cohesive unit. My part time position at Warehouse Fashion Stores  was invaluable in refining my teamwork and communication skills. 

I am aware that disagreements may arise when working in a team but I learnt that each individual is unique, and that in fact opposing views are a good thing as can complement each other, and help adopt a broader perspective.

As this program offers a valuable opportunity for us to freely express innovative business ideas, the expression and the presentation of ideas becomes inevitably important in order to let others understand. Given this situation, I have to admit that I am currently not a good public speaker and I am not confident and comfortable presenting my own thoughts. So, the most important experience I am hoping to develop is the experience of confidently share my thoughts with others especially in presentations.
 What skills and experiences do you already have that you can contribute to this project?
The most practical experiences I have learnt from my previous internships are to think through the perspective of others, to see things standing in customers’ shoes. This thinking pattern of switching roles will help generate ideas that are really applicable, practical and constructive to our target customers.
What potential challenges do you think will arise over the course of this experience that you can learn from?
First, as this is an Australian program, all constituted ideas are Australia-based. Studying as an international student, I am not familiar with Australian working and living style and other preferences of local people. This will definitely reduce my confidence when proposing my ideas t Australian professionals.
Second, since the program is based on teamwork, it is possible that I will be allocated in a team of natural public speakers and I do not even have a chance to express myself. However, I have been constantly encouraging myself to get engage and interact with others.
Let’s hope my teammates and I can present a perfect pitch.

These theories are quite abstract regardless that we did cases study and tried to analyse how the theories work in the real world. 

I hope the Deloitte business innovation program would enable me to bring my business knowledge and experience to a new horizon. I would like to further enhance my teamwork skills with my knowledge and experience on team dynamics leadership. In addition, I would like to learn how to incubate a business innovation idea to the real application. Even if we are unlikely to actually carry our project out, I would like to learn the process that it becomes feasible. 

When I took the leadership courses, I was in a leadership service learning program. This project was about resolving an issue or bringing changes to the local community by influencing others and take actions. We successfully arrange a visit for the local countryside students to our university and helped to initiate cooperation on the executives level of our university and the primary schools. I think this experience would give me some hints on how to start a business innovation project. I truly hope this experience would be a platform that help to build connections of my past experience and future thinking. 

I hope this experience would be the key element that finish the circle of experiencing, watching, thinking, and doing. I think the major challenge would be that we are going to incubate an idea that is born in a different business environment and work with people of great diversity. We have to mitigate the conflicts and bring out a feasible project. I see this as both a challenge and an opportunity. I believe this experience would be quite rewarding.

I had experience participating in a national student business challenge (the Big Idea Competition 2012) over the course of my undergraduate study. It was a social enterprise competition where I, in a team of five students, proposed an innovative social entrepreneurship idea with the aim to provide marginalised people with employment opportunity. We constructed a business plan, presented it to the judge panel and were proudly awarded as the national winning team. During this experience, I demonstrated exceptional creativity, teamwork and presentation skills. In the team, I was particularly good at initiating ideas and raising concerns on impactful aspects that were not well considered and discussed by the rest of the team. 

In my current position as a Management Accountant Trainee at the University of Sydney, I demonstrated strong problem solving, communication and interpersonal skills. I am able to effectively communicate with internal and external stakeholders to assist with their inquiries on financial reporting and account management. One of my major achievements is that I created a spreadsheet model to automate the salary subsidies calculation for various University departments, which significantly improves the efficiency of their budget and cost reporting process. In the meanwhile, I also developed excellent research, analytical and time management skills over the course of my postgraduate study.

Throughout Fastback program, I can develop a strong presentation skill and teamwork skill since this program is going to give me variety of challenges in real world business within a team. Furthermore, after learning the first milestone, I can dig deeper into what skills I am going to learn. For self-skills, self-awareness, self-management and stress management skill are what I am hoping to achieve after this course. With these skills in the future, I hope I would prepare better and increase my confidence before any project. For team-skills, creating good relationship skill is what I am looking for. Since I have not engaged in real and professional business world for such a long period (like this program)  before, I wish I could create some relationships with not only new friends but also some professional mentors who come from Deloitte or other organisations. This is what I feel the most challenge, hence I hope this course can guide and force me to practice this skill. For project-skills, time management skill is what I am going to focus, since the real world requires a lot of works to do within a short time-frame, and this become a big challenge for any students who are not really familiar with. For learning-skill, drawing lesson and learning by failing skill is very crucial for me. After all of these skills above, this skill will eventually help me 'fail faster, fail cheaper, fail often enough to succeed' in order to improve my odd. This is exactly what I am missing before. By learning this skill, I hope I could steep my learning curve.

Regarding what skills and experiences I already have to contribute, there are several skills and experiences that I hope they would bring benefit to my future team and my clients. I already have presentation skill, teamwork skill, research skill, good communication skill and proficient in using computer program like Word, Excel and so on. My best skill is presentation skill since I feel confidence with public speaking. My teamwork skill can be described as I am willing to connect people, to listen to others, to make better relationship, to create constructive comments, to help my team work effectively in a professional and productive manner. 

My experiences include some industry experiences as well as part-time job experiences. I already experienced working environment in a Vietnamese bank but in short period. I also experienced assessment centre of Industry Placement Program of University of Sydney in October 2014, but I failed this assessment centre because they required higher IELTS result. Some other experiences of mine includes working experience in some restaurants while I was studying.

Communication Skills
As an international student, communication skills are what I want to learn most. I think to me, communication is not only about language but also about understanding. I hope I could get more chances to work with people from different backgrounds to learn how to communicate effectively with others.
Networking Skills
In terms of networking skills, I hope I could develop basic skills in networking over the course. As I am in my third semester of study, I will start looking for a job in the near future. I want to do better in networking to get more opportunities. 
Presentation Skills
Presentation skills, including PowerPoint skills, are what I expect to improve through the course. Although I have done some presentations in class, I would like to enhance my presentation skills especially in a business environment.
Research Skills
I think in this programme, we need to do research not only by surfing the Internet and going to the library but also by contacting people in the related industry.
Writing Skills
I hope I will be able to write in a professional manner after I finish this course. 

Skills I have
Teamwork Skills
I enjoy working in a team. I don't think everybody is necessarily to be a team leader. Different people play different roles in a team so that the team will work more efficiently. I am good at taking my role in a team. 

Potential Challenges
Time Management
As the units I am taking this semester are fairly hard and time-consuming, it is significant that I could manage time well. Seeing those deadlines on my planner, I could imagine a bunch of nights with very little sleep.
Potential Pressure
As mentioned in class, there will be a lot of pressure when deadlines come closer. It would be very challenging that we should work efficiently under pressure.

At this moment, I have a very preliminary understanding of what innovation and strategy is, and hope that the challenge will help me develop a clearer understanding of the two areas. I see the challenge as an opportunity to learn and apply relevant theories to a real-life project. This will be highly beneficial to my future within an organisation or as an entrepreneur. 

I also hope to further develop my lateral thinking skills. Being influenced by my major in HR and undergraduate studies in Socio-Legal studies, the large majority of my thinking on business defaults to a social science, people-orientated understanding of issues. I feel that this challenge will assist me in developing a more strategic, multidisciplinary view of organisations and their operations. 

Another key skill that I hope to hone over the course of this experience is pitching. I have noticed that I can be a strong communicator. But when I am asked to speak about myself or my efforts in front of others, I feel a sense of discomfort. I believe that by being required to pitch our own business ideas in front of a professional panel will stretch my capabilities and push me to improve in this area. By the end of the program, I would like to confidently stand in front of a room and introduce my achievements and future ideas. 


I have worked extensively in groups through my professional experience as a brand ambassador, sales assistant, legal assistant, market researcher, postgraduate mentor and personal shopper. I am aware of the obstacles of working in a team but feel that I am able to swiftly identify and resolve any issues that may arise. I often play a leadership role where I help build team cohesion, negotiate difficult group behaviours and ensuring that the team remains task orientated. I feel that these experiences will be especially important as the challenge is ultimately a team project and its success really depends on our ability to work harmoniously towards a common goal. 

I can also contribute my problem solving skills to this challenge. As a personal shopper, clients present me with a set-list of desired purchases which are often rare and limited edition fashion items. I am able to quickly and accurately devise and execute a course of action. Within this role, I learnt how to manage my time and communicate with a variety of stakeholders.

BUSS6505 is a practical course for us to step one foot out of the university and into the workplace. Interpersonal skill is a must in a real workplace. It assists me in understanding and communicating with my colleagues more efficiently. Furthermore, since this is a project involving innovation, creativity is essential. Meanwhile it is also important to put oneself in the other’s shoes so that your creativity can actually help people and become the new business practice. Last but not the least, I wish to be more confident when giving a public speech although I am not that fluent in English.

The skill that I already possess is some basic knowledge of international business, accounting and finance. Besides, I can do quality research for relevant information. I am detailed oriented and patient, although I cannot always lead a team. Also, I have been working as a part-time cashier for a supermarket and have some basic knowledge of the retail industry.

I think one of the challenging problems could be to reach an agreement within the team. If every member tries to express his/her ideas and not willing to make a compromise, the ideas will not develop and evolve. Secondly, doing in depth research and analysis could also be challenging. You need to understand a field or industry really well to come up with creative and practical ideas that will make a difference. This process could be difficult since it is time-consuming and need a lot of effort. When an idea is proven to be unrealistic or impractical, you will need to let it go and raise new ideas as quickly as you can.

Teamwork is very important too. Because the research project is impossible to be done by any single person, we need to discover the advantage of each person in our team and make sure equivalent job is allocated among them. That is a both teamwork issue and a management issue.

I liked the content and interactions on the platform. And I look forward to posting my ideas after some further research. As I was learning the fundamentals for the challenge, especially the Lean Innovation Launchpad, I reflected on the fruitless (until now) business plan my friends and I went through one and a half years ago in Canberra. 

At the time, I was studying actuarial control cycle, and therefore applied the business model building process I learned in class. Our innovative idea was to feature the unique ingredients from New Zealand, for example Harakeke and Manuka Honey, as organic and natural skincare had become the mainstream. The business planning process took us around 6 months. After that, we became confused with what to do next and paused the planning when I moved to Sydney.

Now as I recall one fundamental mistake we made was insufficient research. The idea of what our customers need was largely based on our personal experience. We had four people in the group. The two females, including me, had very similar skin type. And the two males rarely used any skincare products except for sunscreen. The sample size was too small. As such, we overly focused on the business idea without clearly defining a problem we wanted to solve. If we could start again, I would suggest our group starting with cold calling and questionnaire to collect more evidence, so that we could identify a problem before putting our effort into anything else.

Another major mistake was that we were using the wrong framework: business modelling is not everything. If we further proceeded to customer development and agile development, we could have put more of our planning into practice and become more motivated.

This experience will equip me with skills that I would like to develop in the future (such as presentation skills, critical thinking, team collaboration, etc.) and will differentiate me from other competitors in employment. 

What's more, in the first session, although most of the candidates are international students, their spoken English is very fluent and they seem to be very confident. These two abilities are also what I want to develop further. 

I just finished an summer internship in an accounting firm in China, and their business and services are similar with Deloitte so that maybe I already have an insight about what areas or business sectors they cover, what their clients are and so on. I am also good at collaborate with people since I was the president of public relations department when I was doing my bachelor's degree. Our department once successfully published a welcoming magazine (over 3000 copies) for freshmen and I personally raise funds for over 20,000 RMB. Thus, my accounting and auditing knowledge and my extracurricular activity experiences would make an effort to my team to generate great ideas.  

The most thing I worry about or the most challenging thing is that we are working as a student not an employee in Deloitte, so we can not get access to some confidential files or key information that might help us to understand the industry better. Another thing to add is that innovation is a very general idea and it is hard to turn up ideas in the air. we have to seek ideas from our mentors, Deloitte's clients even some experts. Sometimes, getting touch with a key person is the most difficult thing in the world. Lastly, arguments and disputes may happen during our discussion, and I hope we can solve disagreements in a gentle way. lol",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

I believe that I can contribute to this program by offering my comprehension of the theories learnt from my strategy major over the past year.  Additionally, my experience in accounting would also be useful as it enables me to devise the most practical and cost efficient solution. 

I believe that the Fastrack experience would provide me with the essential business experience that is relevant to my education, as it would allow me to apply theories into practice. Since I aspire to be a consultant upon graduation, being part of this Deloitte program would allow me to simultaneously experience how it feels to be in the shoes of a consultant and set forth my career. I aim to emerge as a more confident individual after this program and be more comfortable about expressing myself in front of an audience. 

Although this experience is extremely beneficial, I do foresee several challenges. This experience would force me to step out of my comfort zone, as putting theories into practice would require a lot of adaptation. Additionally, the emphasis on teamwork signals that there would be a lot of disagreements and managing those differences would be a challenge. Above that, this program is unlike a normal course in school as it is more interactive and requires a great deal of peer learning.  Hence, this would require a lot of independent learning. Finally, it was mentioned that we would have to fail our ideas during the development stage, this has taught me to view failure from another perspective. 

Overall, I am confident that I would gain tremendously from this program. I believe that the anticipated challenges are learning opportunities that would be beneficial in both my personal as well as professional development.

Therefore project management is one of the skills that I want to develop the most from the whole process, which is, from problem identification, market research and feasibility analysis, method pitching to the final presentation. Another skill that I am keen to develop is brainstorming in a business environment. The Ideazone is great tool to help me with it and I have already seen some sparkling ideas and had discussed with other students. As an accounting student, presentation is also a skill that is not my expertise but I would like to improve. I hope I could on my way to be a good public speaker after the program. 
My academic backgrounds, skills and experience could contribute to the project as well. I have a firm understanding of accounting and business. I am a quick learner and have an open mind, which makes it easy for me to adapt to a new business environment. My previous working experiences as a junior accountant as well as an audit intern enable me to have knowledge of business operations and environments and deliver results under high pressure. I also have developed my time management and customer communication skills through my working. I believe my skills and experience would help me and my team with the innovation process and achieve satisfactory results.
Since I am new to this kind of project, I am sure that there would be challenges for me or my team. For example, it’s my first time to know the Lean LaunchPad methodology and I might need some time to fully understand and use it properly. As a team, we might need to be aware of the pace of the project and keep track on our time or we might fail behind the timetable and under high time pressure. The team might have different ideas and opinions and a consensus could not be reached. The idea that we focus and spend most of our time on might turn out to be not applicable and we might need to find a new one. But I believe that those challenges are just opportunities for me and my team to learn new knowledge, further improve our project management, time management, and communication skills.

Learning from my previous working experiences and extracurricular activities, I know how to communicate with people, being a good teammate and improve the working efficiency, which will contribute to this project. For example, I worked as an intern of PWC this summer and one of the jobs is to gather accounting materials from the client and to prepare confirmation letters to related parties. Since the client has a large economic scale with sixteen subsidiaries, scattered at different levels in a building, but poor internal communication system among them, I need to ask every subsidiary separately for similar information to generate confirmation letters whereas most of the collected data is fragmented and needed to be filtered and further inquired. Thus, these uncompleted data of subsidiaries requires huge amount of work to organize and to present on confirmation letters. Because required information from all subsidiaries has high similarity, I generate an Excel spreadsheet categorizing all compulsory statistics into a column of subsidiaries before handing out to every client as a checklist. With the irreplaceable help of this spreadsheet, I can easily identify uncollected materials and label fragment or errors improving our efficiency exponentially. 
However, I am not good at answering the questions when giving a presentation. I cannot quickly come up with an answer and organize it well. Thus, I am eager that I can improve my ability of solving problems under pressure. What’s more, I hope I can know more about Australia business environment as well as gain working experiences and innovation ability when finishing this course. 

To be honest, I feel a little nervous right now since my first language is not English. I am afraid it will become a communication barrier, affecting the efficiency and validity of my team’s work.

Q1
The first thing I want to develop is the critical thinking skill. A fresh idea is still far away from the true ‘innovation’, and critical thinking is vital through the whole development process as people need to consider all potential influences the idea may generate. When trying to solve some realistic problems, I hope I can, with teacher’s and classmates’ help, think from different aspects which I do not usually consider, and consequently, learn to think comprehensively.

Secondly, I also want to know how the group-work actually works. In the past, for almost all group work, there was an implied acceptance that Chinese people were willing to work with each other. More specifically, we finished our own parts individually first, and then just simply put all parts together. I really want to develop skills like expressing and communicating opinions with group members (in English of course). Through brain storming and group discussing, I hope to learn how people from different culture background consider a same problem and how they cooperate with each other.



Q2
I used to travel around the United States, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia by myself, which means I experienced how different countries solve realistic problems in some areas like transportation, immigration, and social welfare. These experiences can be used as future reference  when the group are trying yo figure out alternatives. 
On the other hand, as I got good marks on subjects like auditing, statistics, and corporate finance, I think I am good at data analysis, which do not simply mean counting numbers, using formulas, but also mean analyzing the true causation behind data-change tendency. Innovation can never be developed by utopian scheme, but need enormous support from data and theory, and I can help with my team members with that.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

The core of my career plan is to participate in consulting jobs within a multinational firm. Therefore, this program is a great opportunity for me to learn the essential skills for being a consultant. 

The first skill I am hoping to develop is the ability of defining the essence of the problem. Such the skill requires me to work like a detective, for example, tracking all the clues and stating briefly what the problem is. It may involve the practice on my researching and analytical skills. Even my critical thinking ability is expected to be improved.

The second skill I am hoping to develop is the problem solving skill. Thinking like a doctor means I am expected to solve the problems of firms, but in a creative and innovative way. I believe that requires me to open mind and adopt any new point of view. I am hoping to know more about the real business world, and learn how to solve the issues with the skills I’ve learnt from university. 

The third skill I am hoping to develop is the collaboration skill. The first lesson of such the skill is about how to accomplish tasks by cooperating with teammates or colleagues. 

Furthermore, I am hoping to develop my communication skill. Based on my past experience, ‘listening’ is an extremely important skill that we should have learnt. Our business idea must be feasible and we need to make sure that our clients are willing to accept our innovation plans. That requires us to transmit our ideas in a brief and understandable way, therefore our ideas can be sold to the clients.

I was studying Economics and Finance which provide me a strong analytical skill and market sensitivity. Furthermore, my sales experience helps me to communicate with others more wisely and efficiently.

With the scientific model, I can manage things in a more logical and effective way. Second is the practical working experience, like what are the communication techniques when dealing with people like colleague, supervisor and client in the workplace. 
Secondly, the skills and experiences I think I can contribute the most are my previous experience working as accountant back in China. Although it might be some differences as compared to that of Australia, I have a sense of how to work collaborate with others in business. Also, I am quite familiar with the software like Power Point, Words and Outlook, which I think would be very helpful when making the presentation.
Thirdly, the potential challenge comes down to two aspects. First is the language. English is my second tongue and this course requires a lots of talking not just in presentation but also in the situation where you need to contact your clients or consult with professionals in Deloitte. The other challenge is the network, as a student, I am lack of human connections which might be needed when connecting with clients. As for the language challenge, I also regard this as a chance of lovely breakthrough. Effectively, I feel more comfortable when making free talk in private, rather than in public. So I think I can overcome this by practicing more. Regarding to the network, with the help of professionals in Deloitte, teacher and our team members, we can try to work out an idea with more possible workable outcomes, so it would be more likely for us to put into action.

Reflection is one of those aspects which is commonly dreaded and viewed as tedious or difficult. As a result, this can impact on the ease and quality of the reflection. Reflection is often seen as self-explanatory, and like the video explained, leads to reflections being more descriptive and depicting ‘what’ and ‘when’ rather than looking into thoughts and feelings. I must agree that my reflections thus far have taken primarily this form and I believe that now, guided with extensive instructions, I am able to attempt to reflect more effectively.
 
Something I also wish to reflect upon is the talk with Bob Carr. The talk illustrated the challenges and barriers between the relationship and trust building of China and Australia. The tension between China and the Western world has been evident in many points of history but as a young person, I wish to be part of the society and bond of China and Australia. The questions involving young people that Andrea put forwards were insightful in regards to our role as young people in this relationship. It also gives insight to the role in this CAMP project.

I am feeling pretty excited and also understand there is a lot of work to do.
We had our first team meeting via Skype last Sunday which was great as we got to learn more about each other which is critical.
Overall we are in agreement with what needs to be done and we are all committed
On hindsight, I should have followed more closely to the timelines as set out by CAMP around some of the activities. The recommended timelines act as a good way to gauge whether I am on track
The idea of rotating chairs of the team meeting is good.
Clear agenda is required to ensure we make best use of everyone's time
I would prefer to limit team communication to a few channels. At the moment we have wechat, Skype, practera, trello, qq, emails.
Our next catchup ie tonight will be good to see where everyone is at.
Weekly committed catch ups is also great to ensure we keep communicating
It is challenging to work with people virtually. Would prefer to have more of the team located in proximity. However, working virtually is big part of the CAMP experience!
One particular teammate is quite advanced in completing the activities and tasks. He might feel that he is the only one driving this. The rest of the team (including myself) absolutely need to get up to speed and show similar commitment. If his commitment is too much, then we need to manage expectations. We need to be united and all on the same page.

I felt really chuffed about getting one of the sponsored places. Due time mismanagement – partially due to being overly idealistic about the outcome – and some technology failures, my application was not as good as I had planned. 
Went well: My application was successful! At crunch time, I forced myself to do a ‘first cut’ and then relentless iterated until I had something that was submittable. 

Went badly: I spent too much time thinking & planning and not “doing”. I was overly self-critical about the process. Some tech failures meant I had to re-do the work several times. 
Do differently: Although it’s not my usual nature, I must try to start ‘doing’ far, far sooner, rather than thinking, analysing and planning without actions. Alternatively, in teams, I should seek complementary ‘doers’ to match my ‘thinker’ profile. Also, I should back up my work.

During O-week

Excited and inspired! …and a little frustrated.
As CAMPer profiles started getting published, and as collaboration on WeChat started kicking off I was excited if not overwhelmed by the sheer awesome factor of people I will have opportunity to meet. 
I was even more excited to see I was part of Practera Play – so perfectly aligned with my interests. 
I was also frustrated, though, as I could not contact my team easily to get the ball rolling. I felt like I was constantly trying to get in touch and motivate them to participate and get their engagement. I also felt like, with this calibre of people, that all people at CAMP should be proactive and self-organising. So I felt disappointed that this appeared not to be the case. 

Do differently:
I am actually not sure yet, but certainly something was not effective.

For me, I didn't feel that same level of excitement as everyone else, perhaps because I had mentally come to the point where I thought I was not going to be a part of the program.

But now I’m part of CAMP, and I’m excited! I have been really proactive in getting in touch with other CAMPers – meeting one another via online social media. I am part of the Westpac sponsored Global Talent think tank, and our topic is to “explore how we can harness global talent to become an advantage in both Australia and China competing in the international market place”.
In my original proposal to CAMP, I wrote “The foundation of any relationship is trust…For Australia and China to have a positive relationship in face of potential major global economic and geopolitical change, we need to start building trust now.”

I feel that this is equally as broad as our topic to “harness global talent”, and I hope that through the coming weeks I can really work with my project team on developing a framework for which we can begin tackling this question.
When I first found out that the Global Talent Think Tank would only have Westpac employees I was a little disappointed. I wanted the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse group of young people, and working with people in the same organisation seemed to defeat the purpose.  

However, upon reflection, I decided that it is perhaps a blessing in disguise. I believe that our group can come up with a proposal for our organisation, Westpac, to allow us to be a super-player in the China-Australia market. Our ability to access our cross-cultural offices from Sydney, China, Hong Kong and Singapore means we have a pool of resources ready to be tapped into.

Being in teams, it already reminds me of the dreaded group assignments back at university. I am finding it difficult to get everyone on the same page. To start, just arranging a team meeting has taken countless WeChat messages and multiple emails. Further, having the bigger think tank split into two project groups has made it even more confusing. Better ways of communicating is definitely in order, to adjust to people’s schedules and time zones. The one major problem I have with the program is that although it said a 5hour commitment, it’s actually much more. Once we have a better plan of attack for how to approach this topic, it would make quantifying the project plan much easier. All in time for the next reflection blog post!

Human have the behaviour to repeat to the action that makes them feels good and avoid those they dislike. When we replay the event during reflecting writing, it make us remember how we feel, it helps us to identify the significant events and what is the consequences about the decisions, this become a guideline for us in the future event.

The happy experience we gain on the event, eventually will lead us to think about more ideas on what can we improve when we facing the same situation next time, this helps to empower not only ourselves but also the team to be more confidence on our future action and able to work closely together.

It also provides an opportunity for us to think things from a different prospective. Not only on what we can improve but also think about what if it done differently, will the result be the same if that is the case.
Perhaps the assumption of the incidence was wrong and we have to replay the event again. This review and assumption might bring in more value, we might found out the current knowledge we have is not enough for us to face the future event,  extra training or tools might be necessary for us to do better next time. The process and learning might be more valuable than what we learn in the particular event.

I believe the reflective writing can help me understand the event better and to share my experience to everyone in my team at CAMP.

We are meeting tonight for the first time so I hope to learn more about fellow delegates, Westpac colleagues then. There is some great content on leadership and Human Centred Design in the portal and I'm looking forward to applying this to our challenge question. I'm feeling a little overwhelmed as we haven't started yet and we are already in week 3. There is a fair bit to catch up on so we need to get cracking. Time to make hay while the sun's still shining.
","It was fantastic to explore the Practera course material this week and meet fellow delegates for the first time to share our ideas. Everyone is very enthusiastic and keen to get started.

The opportunity to meet and engage with everyone during the broader summit is still on the horizon and its motivating to know we are working towards this. 

The Global Talent think tank has come together with extra gusto. It was great to be able to share  the genesis of Westpac's involvement with the team. The opportunity to sponsor CAMP was initiated when CAMP CEO Andrea Myles won the AFR Westpac Women of Influence award. From there she was able to share her idea with Westpac CEO Gail Kelly. With Westpac’s own strategy in China driven by the same principle as CAMPs sponsoring this initiative made sense and we've seized on the opportunity.

Each member of Global Talent has different motivations for getting on board but we are all united by a common goal to overcome cross-cultural barriers and foster stronger relationships to support Westpac's own growth in Asia. In many ways I think this will drive and motivate our think tank to deliver something of value to the company. 

We have set up well for our first assignment to conduct field research among industry experts. I hope we can uncover some rich insights to give us direction as we dive deeper into the subject of global talent.

Firstly, I will reflect on the ‘reflective writing’ and ‘experiential learning’ video events that I have just watched and then I will reflect on my short experience so far with CAMP. 

The ‘reflective writing’ and ‘experiential learning’ videos events described a process of how to reflect upon a past event in order to get the most learning out of it. It provided me with an ‘aha’ moment – the value of the reflective thinking isn’t in just being descriptive and backward looking, the real value is in being forward thinking, discovering what the potential implications of the event are, and then analysing what improvements could be made. It was both an exciting revelation but also a daunting one – exciting because I had my revelatory moment but daunting because it would be difficult to do it well. It was interesting I thought that the ‘experiential learning’ video described reading the newspaper as a form of ‘cognitive’ learning only – I disagree and think that it is a reflective exercise given that you can analyse the news, reflect on the event that has happened and think about what improvements could have been made or how the event could have happened differently even if it didn’t affect you directly. 

I feel good about the CAMP process so far. The organisers and participants seem equally keen to take as much learning experience out of the event as possible. I guess it is lessons like the reflective thinking experience that I want to be able to take away from CAMP because it will help me develop my skill-set and be able to contribute effectively back to the program.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

It was my objective to work hard and submit my best possible application in order to be accepted into the program.  A key personal and professional objective of mine is to focus on Australia China relations and CAMP will enable me to pursue this dream.
My ‘Ah-ha’ moment is that the more you put in, the more you will get out.  I have found that if you 100% commit to something. you will achieve what you set out to do. 
I started looking for ‘Australia China opportunities’ over Christmas 2014 and found out about CAMP.  Since being accepted as a CAMP delegate, I have found out about more organisations and opportunities that I can aim to be involved with in the future. 
Reading the other delegates profiles made me feel even more humbled and honoured to have the opportunity to work with such dynamic colleagues.  I am reaching out to others and am making personal connections. 
After using the online forum, I have found that some delegates will not be on the same social media platforms.  I want to try to find the best way to connect on a regular basis with my group.

","I am very excited to be a key member of the CAMP2015 community.  It was my objective to work hard and submit my best possible application in order to be accepted into the program.  A key personal and professional objective of mine is to focus on Australia China relations and CAMP will enable me to pursue this dream.

My ‘Ah-ha’ moment is that the more you put in, the more you will get out.  I have found that if you 100% commit to something. you will achieve what you set out to do. 

I started looking for ‘Australia China opportunities’ over Christmas 2014 and found out about CAMP.  Since being accepted as a CAMP delegate, I have found out about more organisations and opportunities that I can aim to be involved with in the future. 

Reading the other delegates profiles made me feel even more humbled and honoured to have the opportunity to work with such dynamic colleagues.  I am reaching out to others and am making more personal connections. 

After using the online forum, I have found that some delegates will not be on the same social media platforms.  I want to try to find the best way to connect on a regular basis with my group.  I have started communications through WEChat, but feel I am not yet connected professionally with all team members.  I will email the group and see if this tactic works better. 

I want the ‘future of tourism’ think tank to be the strongest and most interactive of all Think Tanks.  Having strong connections with the team will be imperative to achieve this.

After briefly chatting to a few of my teammates in the Future of Tourism ThinkTank, I am becoming more excited and ready to begin our project together. It’s nice to know what my team-members are like and we already seem to be getting along well. The more I read on the CAMP website, and the more I learn about my fellow CAMPers, the overall desire to do something that will help others and make a positive impact on the world grows, and so does the realisation that we can
What is my 'Aha' moment?
Upon registering for this, I thought it would be a great learning experience and an opportunity to broaden my skill set, which is still very true. I am also realising that this whole program gives myself and my team a shot at making huge changes in the world around us. There is a going to be a very tightly-bound future between China and Australia, and everyone in this program has can make the relationship better for the peeple and the environment at large.
What went well?
The orientation milestone went well for myself, I found that all articles and videos we were given to read were not only interesting to read, but also very inspiring. I feel like I've gained a greater understanding of what great leadership really means. It’s not about being able to tell people what to do, but to be able to help others as much as you can. I really enjoyed the paragraph of Dan Palotta’s words “ the best creativity […] comes from a desire to contribute to the lives of others”.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Start with the positives! Builds team and individual confidence.
1) What can we improve?
The method of group discussion, Wechat might not be the best way to communicate to make sure that everyone's opinion get enough comments on time. 
2) Address key areas, team expectations and process
Tourism, tourism that brings urban and rural together, tourism that links Australia and China. Sustainable tourism, voluntourism, exchange tourism experiences and culture tourism have been discussed and put into consideration.
3) What could have been done differently?
Very good experience for a first group ""meeting""
4) What will we do to better prepare for future events?
More research needs to be done individually before the ""meeting"" so that abstracted insight may be shared among the group efficiently 
5) Identify training, tools, or techniques & action items

I have recognised China's importance in the world for a long time, but I still don't know much about its culture, business practice, politics, I don't speak the language, I have never been. One of my key strength is that I am a learner... I am curious and I love learning. 

When I first started my responsible tourism venture, I didn't focus on China as I just thought that they were mainly traveling with organised tours. When I attended a breakfast event with David Thomas, a BRIC expert with a China focus, I found out that tourism was one of their priorities in their current 5 years plan and then I found out that China is now the biggest source market for tourism (UNWTO). I started reading more on that and realised that a new generation of  younger, more independent and knowledgable traveler segment was emerging and there was a HUGE potential to influence them to become a Conscious Explorer and create a bigger collective impact. So I become really interested in participating CAMP to learn more about China so Freeedom is better position to leverage this opportunity. CAMP has been a catalyst to take action and start learning about China, so I have signed up for a MOOC on China to increase my cultural knowledge and hope this experience will help me understand more the challenges and opportunities ahead. I am excited, but nervous as there is so much to learn and I want to really make the most of this opportunity.

In the past week, I was sent overseas for an interview and had a few more interviews as soon as I arrived back in Sydney, so I was unable to get on to CAMP. Now that I am back, I am ready to jump into the team and get things rolling.

I've joined the WeChat group for my think tank and am introducing myself to the team. Although I feel slightly guilty in my lack of participation to date, I am committed to working with the team and am excited to see what we can do.

What can I improve?
I will be actively participating in the team activities, without letting my schedule affect my performance. I have always believed that a 'lack of time' is merely an excuse for poor time management. As such, I am going to stick to my commitment and make sure that I contribute as much to the team as possible.

What am I looking forward to?
I am really looking forward to getting to know my team. I only recently joined Practera and the WeChat group for my team, but I have introduced myself and am going through all the content I missed out on.

I can change my mind without looking silly). a place where I ponder insecurities and develop ways to overcome them, without others knowing. a place where I can keep secrets until I want or need to share them.

When I try to write blogs or reflection pieces now, I feel that I still do the same. Maybe I will get better at this, similar to the video 
In saying this, I do see the benefit in reflective writing.

Excitement for a new experience, challenge, and meeting new people. Also excitement at being chosen and being able to be connected to China once again and build on my previous experiences. Watching Bob Carr's video was a confidence booster. He echoed a lot of my thinking which made me feel I'm on the right track. It also brought up a few areas for me to investigate further - such as gaining a deeper understanding of how Australian business and collaboration in China will be streamlined or made easier by the CHAFTA. I'd also like to gain a better understanding business perceptions between Australia and China and barriers that may be broken down through new CHAFTA mechanisms. 
My apprehension has mostly been a result of not receiving a 'road map' of sorts of the CAMP experience with milestones, timeframes etc. This helps me visualise what is coming up, but I found it took longer than I anticipated to get my head around what this is all about. Its turned out positively really, because the program is far more guided and starts at a more general level than I anticipated (I anticipated being quite out of my depth). It's put me more at ease about the experience and working across my think tank and the group in general. In a way, I like that I feel a bit uncomfortable about how it will all unfold.

I feel like this will be a rewarding journey for all participants involved. Everyone on the program are motivated and like minded in terms of our future outlook on the importance of developing the China Australia relationship, and I am very excited to be part of this cohort of individuals. I feel as the weeks go on, we will create an even closer bond with both our team mates and fellow CAMPers in our own cities. In June, it will be amazing to meet all the other CAMPers from other parts of the world. 
My ‘Aha Moment’ is the realisation of CAMP’s project being able to make a physical different in our community. This makes me believe that great team work and an open minded outlook on this experience can help us achieve great things. Understanding and familiarising with the different skill sets in our team has helped me gain insight into believing that this project can actually help address an issue or challenge currently present with relevance to the ChAFTA. 
I think our group discussions are travelling well. We are able to coordinate Skype meeting despite different time zones, which I think is a positive sign that shows team members are enthusiastic about their commitment to CAMP. We are slowly getting to know each other and I feel this is important to gain understanding of everyone’s personalities, skill sets, mentalities and expectation of CAMP. We can possibly improve on the efficiencies of our Skype session, however we are making the most of our time together and I feel our conference sessions are improving each time. We are currently gathering each team member’s expectations of the CAMP program so we can have a realistic team goal to work towards.

What is your Aha moment? Just learning about whats ahead, it clicked this this can be a really powerful thing if we do it right

What happened? Took me a while but eventually got through all the information :) 

What went well? A lot of support information once i got stuck into the site

What can we improve? Really big expectations regarding the workload we all have to complete which is constructive but potentially too much for people busy in full time roles/volunteering with other things as well, but the whole team can rally around this

What could have been done differently? On day 1 getting a a step by step with due dates so theres a definitive list of what needs to get done

What will we do to better prepare for future events? Perhaps reduce a little what needs to get done each week (this week was find but future weeks look pretty intense) so its more realistic and the things can be done with better quality

But I guess that is the point - to get the hang of reflection blogging (and get over any hang ups with regard to reflection blogging) before the difficult work (which will require a lot of reflection) really starts. 

What happened?
I have only managed to chat with one of my team members, but I have browsed the site and tried to get the hang of it. I have looked at people's profiles, and interacted with a few. I have posted my introductions, posted my inspiration and posted a question. I used the chat function to meet some of my team members.

How do I feel about what has happened so far?
I was super excited to get started with CAMP. I feel that there is so much potential here for kickstarting dreams and meeting inspiring people. 
I was a bit overwhelmed by the technology of the site, so I just threw myself into using the functions to try to get over this feeling. 
I still feel a bit confused about how the next few weeks will progress, but I am trying to trust the process and see where it leads me. I am someone who likes to know exactly what is going on, and uncertainty makes me nervous, so this is probably a useful experience to facilitation my growth. 

How do I feel about this task?
I am no stranger to reflection- it is a practice that I undertake daily. This is in part due to my yoga practice which encourages me to reflect upon and question my state of mind, my emotions and my reactions as a daily practice. So the act of reflection I am very comfortable with and I understand how it facilitates my own growth. But I have never been able to bring myself to write my reflections down because putting my thoughts on paper makes me feel vulnerable and exposed. So writing this reflection blog will be another way to test my boundaries and get outside my comfort level. 

Skills Audit
Communication Skills: I am a natural introvert. Strong in written communication, OK at public speaking and delivering presentation and training but only if well prepared, uncomfortable at off the cuff communication/brainstorming in groups but more comfortable with one-on-one communication.
Community Development/Community Project/Capacity Building: Strong community development experience, building capacity in community organisations and experience working cross-culturally and working for social change.
Creative thinking: I love thinking creatively, finding solutions and looking at the big picture. 
Administration/Business Management: I am not detail oriented and struggle with administrative tasks. Can do them if required, but it is one of my biggest weaknesses.
Grant Writing: Have excellent grant writing skills, and enjoy the creative challenge of persuading funders that the project is in their interests.
Grant management: Have experience managing grants- can do this well, but it is not my best strength (see Administration)
Finances: I have a finance major and am naturally mathematical, so I am not intimidated by financial management and budgets. However as I am not detail oriented, this is not my strong point either.
Marketing/Promotion: I am comfortable with telling the story of a project/product in an authentic manner, but feel completely uncomfortable about promoting myself and my work and networking.

It's pleasing to know that my own philosophy of continuous reflection and improvement are captured as part of the experiential learning, and that I naturally perform experiential learning in most things that I do. 
I think a key will be collaboration often and early with the group as the more thoughts we share, the more we might add to the conversation ourselves. I also think the group must be willing to try all potential options and feel that this is a safe environment to contribute without retribution. But at the same time, we must all be open to truly accept honest opinions and criticism of ideas and thoughts.
I must also say that I'm disappointed not to be allocated to the think tank which is being sponsored by my company AMP.

The team is working together well so far and although there is some ambiguity around what we are doing are approaching it with a positive attitude. I think it is going to be an enjoyable project. 

I was relieved when the team agreed that we wanting to focus on creating something more practical rather than academic in relation to supporting entrepreneurs. This means we can actually create something that will help people.

I thought I already submitted this reflection and I'm really sad that I lost it, since I wrote (what I thought) was a good response. Either way, the reflection was worthwhile even if I don't have the text evidence of it any more! Don't have time to write it out again so just submitting this explanation.","Not entirely sure how to begin this, so will select a relatively specific learning experience and reflect upon its implications. Pretty tough to concentrate because this man sitting next to me at the library has taken off his shoes and His. Feet. Stink. Anyway, moved away from there so now can at least breathe. Whilst working at an NGO Beijing our team was small, with an average of six staff working on any one day. Morning team meetings worked best with full attendance and sharing between members. The unspoken agreement was that team meetings went ahead when all members had arrived. As such it was quite disruptive if a staff member was late to early morning team meetings, which in theory started at 9.15 with a work day starting at 9 but often began much later around 10.30. I found it frustrating as I was usually punctual and found that any work before the meeting was less productive and meetings conducted later were less effective. I felt that it was causing friction within the team and now that I reflect I did, despite my best efforts to be understanding, feel some animosity towards latecomers. I think given that we were a small team, latecomers were more obvious and they also felt embarrassed about holding up the proceedings. Each team-member was invited to suggest solutions, this was a fair proposal in my mind as it allowed us to discuss the impact that delayed meetings had on setting the team's agenda and also it allowed us to appreciate that some staff members faced staggering commute times in stressful Beijing traffic. This allowed our manager to suggest that an earlier start and earlier departure for these members would help them avoid morning and evening rush hours. I appreciate this flexibility and consideration of individual needs, especially given that these issues hadn't been raised by staff members previously. I admire my manager for centring the discussion collaboratively by asking ""What methods can we propose to resolve this issue"" rather than confronting individuals over their tardiness. I hope to emulate similar tact and productive focus in my work. Setting aside some unsuccessful attempts to introduce carrot and stick incentives, the system the team came to agreement upon was a set-in-stone 9.15 meeting, with a new rotating minute-taker and time keeper. Given the adverse effect that waiting for the meeting had on the commencement of the day's work, I believe that the hard-and-fast rule was easy to keep and understand. I think it could be effective to adhere to in future roles with team-based work and coordination meetings. The minute keeping meant that late comers, despite being unable to contribute, were able to quickly update themselves on the day's agenda. Upon its implementation I noticed the previous friction between staff ameliorated somewhat and reduced the embarrassment that late comers felt. This experience amongst others made me realise that I am pretty sensitive to inter-staff tensions, including those which don't directly involve me. Over other things I often feel that having a supportive and positive work environment is primary to having a productive and effective one. Interpersonal conflict is a stressor and point of conflict from which negative impacts can rapidly precipitate. In meetings I try to be a peace maker and defuse small gripes, usually with humour. After this experience I began to notice that in order to maintain amicable atmosphere means I find it difficult to take on leadership roles as I feel that it would unbalance work groups, usually for the worse. However learning from my manager I realised that it is possible to be considerate of others' needs and mental wellbeing whilst also being firm in enforcing work standards.

I feel like I could learn a lot from them. There also seems to be a very positive online community building. I am also really excited about working with my team. 
Being the first week, I am still getting my head around the platform and how each week will be structured.  I am a bit worried that I am forgetting to do important tasks associated with each week. For example, I noticed on our team page that people have started to submit ideas. I am worried that I was meant to submit my ideas earlier I just missed a step. I am hoping that once I complete this week’s activities, and review the platform, it will make more sense to me.  
In the future, I am hoping to develop more structure around my committed time to Camp. I see this as a really great opportunity to meet likeminded people. I feel that committing specific time slots to camp every week will provide me with the best opportunity to meet the deadlines and work with the team. It will also help me keep camp at front of mind while also juggling fulltime work and my masters. 
In summary, my main learning is that I have a lot to learn in order to get the most out of the experience.  That being said, I am very excited and feel very positive about being involved in such a great initiative.

I assume the people are happy, and enjoying the time being together with families and friends. Because they can finally be freed from the stressful and draining work that occupies most of their times. I wonder why society has only become more busier than ever before. With the rise of new technological breakthroughs, the automation of machinaries, the smartphones that makes the world more connected. Life has only become more busier. Does this make people happy? I wonder what human really need to stay happy. If the work they do is not what they are truly passionate about, then they are not really living a life that they want. Instead, they are doing the work that the society has chose them to do. And feeling boxed, and see no other options to live their lives. In fact, life can be much more interesting that paying the bills. We can all choose a lifestyle that fit ourselves. We just have to open our eyes and see the possibilities out there. And whether we choose to adapt that new lifestyle or not, it's a matter of courage. To reflect my own situation, I can not accept a job that is doing meaningless things and just live through the days. And that's also why I haven't been working for more than half year, I understand I cannot sustain for very long living like this, since financially will be an issue. So I am still looking for something that can be meaningful and at the same time can generate revenue. It's an utopian ideal, but I believe I will find it.

Last week I didn't have the best week at work with MyGuru. The same questions keep racing through my mind ""are we really solving a painful problem"", ""is our price point right"", ""how do I communicate our value proposition better"", ""how do I balance all the important things that need to be done with limited resources and time"", ""why aren't people signing up as much as I thought...will this work!!"". 

I was really fed up with this sort of thinking by the end of last week. I usually have a pretty positive outlook on things and tend to be over optimistic as a way of coping with the uncertainties that come with doing something different. I decided to have a weekend away surfing to clear my mind. I then came back and talked to a few mentors of mine who assured me my vision is solid, but highlighted some ways we can definitely be executing better.

These included facing up to the reality that the user experience of our website was shit and we were shit at marketing. Obvious in hind sight but just things I hadn't really been addressing. I think I really need to put myself in more situations where I prove myself wrong, do more hypothesis testing and keep working on the areas that I know we aren't doing well in. Also take more responsibility for these areas, even if they are not my strong points. 

Another part of the feeling I was having last week was definitely that I had set my expectations really high for the first two months of sales and we had failed miserably. In hindsight these targets were crazy, but at least they got me out there and talking about MyGuru rather than sitting around and waiting until it was perfect. This week I am back on track, working on the things we haven't done well on the past.

To begin with, we were sent a series of emails detailing the first phase of CAMP: O-Week, the purpose being to orient ourselves around our new workspace and work out how the rest of the program will operate and how we can engage effectively. This involved several practice things such as posting our own bio and exploring the different areas of the website, such as CAMPsites, which is a forum for organising face-to-face meet-ups by area. 

While initially overwhelming, I found that I eventually got used to the layout of Practera and got a good grasp of how things would be conducted. I found it extremely interesting to read the biographies of the different people attending CAMP, in particular those that will be in the same ThinkTank as I. 

Overall, I can’t see any identifiable negatives to the experience. Instead, it filled me with enthusiasm to get to started!

It's really exciting to have met so many awesome young talents from both countries! Even with online chatting alone, I'm already inspired a lot by the projects they're working on, and their positive changing mindset. It feels really fantastic to have encountered more than a hundred likeminded people from various disciplines in one project. Can't wait to meet them all in Sydney!
As for my Think Tank team, we have 3 members from Australia and 2 members from China including me. Most of them have expertise in infrastructure area with their education background or career experience. Meanwhile, I seem to be the only one with the least background on this area. Although my project and my past entrepreneurial experience are related to it, my knowledge seems really not deep and broad enough. Therefore, I might need to dive more and make solid preparation in order not to affect the smooth conducting of our future team collaboration.
After having gone through Milestone 1 so far, I'd say, the design of this online learning seems really reasonable and rewarding. It's really refreshing to start learning collaboratively after being away from school for almost two years. Also for the same reason, I found that my speed of reading and absorbing content in English has not been efficient enough, especially when it comes to the videos without subtitles. Sometimes I need to pause and digest before I continue.
However, I believe this experience will surely become better soon as I practice more along learning when get used to it again.
It’s the first for me to use Practera, which seems to be a really cool learning platform but with a bit complexity as some places are not very self-explanatory thus a little confusing. But as I explore it more, I found it to be a really awesome place to learn systematically. Looking forward to continuing this journey!

After this first week of CAMP, and in the lead up to starting the experience, I think that I have felt a little bit nervous about the whole experience.  But after reflecting on how I feel and unpacking it, I think that feeling nervous is not necessarily a negative feeling. Nervous energy is about being excited and feeling energised. there is also a certain level of apprehension involved.  Seeing all the other delegates for CAMP talk about their stories makes me question why I am included in their number, and there are certain feelings of inadequacy that creep in.  However, I think that the first week’s learnings around reflection and reflective writing have helped me to unpack and identify what I am feeling, to evaluate the broader context in which these feelings are occurring, and to help me come up with techniques to understand and change my future behaviour in light of my feelings in the past. 

Through reflective thinking, I have been able to look a little bit more objectively about how I feel, and this has forced me to realise that I do have skills to bring to the table, and being timid or unsure of myself is not conducive to the larger goals that we’re trying to achieve.  It’s important to have input from everyone, and being apprehensive or crippled because of feelings of inadequacy does not do anyone any favours.  On the other hand, I must also be cognisant of the fact that different people are probably feeling similarly even though I might perceive them as being extremely impressive judging by their profiles. So, going forward will be important for me to consider this in advance and take all of this into consideration when collaborating with my group and with the wider CAMP audience. The nervous energy is still there, but upon reflection I realise that it is a positive feeling that can help build a better result in the long run if managed appropriately.","Weather report: Nervous!

Sharing our knowledge about infrastructure during our 2nd group meeting and 2. Having another team member helping me out compiling the Empathy Map and doing a really good job of it – team work!

A Would’a Could’a Should’a moment is again the 2nd team meeting. That was my second week as team captain (passed over the baton this week) and I was busy working on my thesis in the four days coming up to the team meeting. We all felt a little behind and disorganised. Thankfully the meeting went well despite us not keeping closely to the agenda and I made up for it afterwards by spending many hours of the following day summarising, working on Practera and planning tasks for my team. However, I told the next team captain that it works much better if everyone gets a summary of the coming week on Monday (like I did in the first week, but didn’t have time to do in the second week). The group feels a bit more organised.

One expectation that I have that will also help us prepare better in the future is: I think everyone in our team needs to open all emails coming from the team captain for that week. Many emails get sent between the team members and it can feel like overload. You don’t always have time to go through everything that day or even the next. But the team captain is the overall organiser for that week and they set the tasks. I found my emails got lost between other people’s emails and important deadlines/task didn’t necessarily get read. So this week, I made sure to read the team captain’s emails no matter how busy I was.

My 'weather report' before our first meeting was 'nervous' and 'apprehensive'.  I wasn't sure how I measured up against the other team members in terms of valuable contributable skillsets and whether our personalities would work well with each other.  One of our team member's was particularly proactive, and sent out quite a few emails and wechat messages before the meeting.  Via email she seemed a strong personality - very organised, but perhaps very strong minded, and I was concerned whether this would translate to being inflexible with how the team was run (a concern of mine, as I am balancing my involvement in CAMP with work commitments).  I was pleasantly surprised out how great our first meeting went.  Talking to my team members, I got a better sense of who they were as people - we are actually quite complementary in skillsets and personalities.  They equally have their own workloads outside of CAMP and we established an understanding our availabilities as individual team members (days and times).  We also discussed what we wanted to get out of CAMP, which was a revealing but oddly clarifying experience. The comment that stood out for me was one shared by a fellow team mate - that there wish was for us as a team to use this as an opportunity for us to be bold with what we come up as there isn't any money associated with this (i.e. we aren't losing any money from this).  This was actually a personal objective that I also had, and it was great to have it verbalised by another with the team. Moving forward, I have been more proactive with being clear in my emails, keeping in mind that people might read them in a particular way and misconstrue their intention.

Most seem to have a background in traditional infrastructure (i.e. standard utilities and treatments systems), but I’m interested to see how we can leverage this to come to some more innovative outcomes to whatever CAMP throws at us.

I feel, qualified to say this as one myself. but, engineers can tend to be conservative, despite being good problem solvers and lateral thinkers. This ends up with us generally taking the safer option (likely through fear of catastrophic failure or being sued). I’m going to make it my mission to make the team think outside the box a little and seek “Big Ideas” rather than incremental improvements.

I feel that, as the site stands right now, it is not at all user friendly or encouraging collaboration. Everything seems siloed and clearly delineated rather than providing a platform for cross pollination. This may just be new user apprehension, so I’m going to do my best to learn the tools to maximise both my, and my teams benefit from this platform.

It is always interesting to be introduced to a new way of classifying, categorising or viewing something and I feel this way about both reflective learning and the behvioural learning model vs cognitive learning. The Aha moment I had is that neither model is wrong and that I adopt both learning styles without being conscious of this - although behavioural learning is easier, likely more effective and more fun, with cognitive learning requiring attention and focus - which can be challenging at times, The key takeaway, is that different styles of learning exist outside the kinestheic, auditory and visual styles that I am familiar with and that these styles are legitimate and adaptable.

I think the reality of the program starting and the commitment I've made has really sunk in. It's taken a couple of weeks for the team to make contact and we have scheduled our first meet this weekend. This makes me feel excited and motivated that we are officially kicking off together. I think it's made me realised that this program is going to fly by and I need to be better prepared and more available to make the most of it while it lasts!! I kind of regret not reaching out to the team earlier - why did I wait? Why was I reluctant? I think this platform and the tools we are being handed are great, insightful and useful but I've maybe been a bit reluctant to really embrace the content and get into it. That's not like me! I'm not sure if I'm maybe intimidated or what...but when I reflect it's certainly made me realise that I'm not leaping into things like I'd like to be.

I'm feeling excited but also a touch anxious about starting the CAMP journey. After almost 2 weeks it's occurred to me that I haven't been anywhere near as proactive and engaged as I would have expected. I'm not sure what I'm waiting for as I've been pretty excited about the start of the program. Our team is yet to meet - so hopefully getting together this weekend and having a chat will help move things along a bit more. I think my reluctance to take charge is partially driven by feelings of the unknown - which is ridiculous in a way given I usually jump at a challenge and love learning new things. It has occurred to me that the program is going to fly by and I need to work harder to immerse myself in this experience and make the most of it.

At first it does not surprise me when I hear from CAMP that I'm in, 'cause I always have confidence and believe good things I wanted would happen. But when it comes to meet so many amazing guys in CAMP's Wechat group, I realized how lucky I was to be here. What's more, focusing on studying and knowing about reflection help gain my knowledge and skills, which encourage me for further knowledge-hunting. But I'm a little bothered by the problem that we teammates have not communicated to each other indeed. Three or four of us said Hi to each other and then became offline. I start to worry about if we could build up good teamwork together the next few weeks. Besides, I nearly know little about our project. Will we get instructors? And how will this project go? I've been thinking about seeking more info.
It's been not long since CAMP began, my ""Aha"" moment are when watching the ""reflection diary"" video, it talks about the reflection between the past experience and future events (Aha, that's one of reflection's meanings), the hinsight of a past event (Aha, me the same.）, and reflection is the process of ringing every drop of learning out of experience (Aha, nice analogy).
Most of my insight come from the learning of reflection writing. There's so much to talk about, I'd just take them down to my notebook.
What I must replay is the intricate process of attending CAMP. I spend days to make my parents agree on me joining CAMP, which they know little about. Through explaining to them about this activity and my thoughts, I suddenly came to realize that I used to share so little with them about my life and my feelings, so that they worry about me a lot.
Besides, I don't quite understand what the "" Would'a Could'a Should'a"" mean. Hope I can catch a chance to understand.
Actions:
1. After finishing the Milestones 1, get in touch with my teammates, build up a wonderful team.
2. Keep learning in practeria, gain more knowledge about this activity and the abilities it will teach us.
3. Update with my parents, in fact I give my mom a call just now.",,Teamwork and collaboration: working effectively in professional teams,,,Business understanding / knowledge: of the sector you will be working in during this experience,,,"Critical analysis and problem-solving. problem definition, independent research, business analysis and solution definition in a professional context "

Everyone was pitching their ideas and there was such a diversity of really good concepts- I felt so excited to be working with such smart, lovely people.    I also feel that CAMP is going to be a really wonderful opportunity to actually think creativity and explore business opportunities which are very different to my day job, but something I am really excited about.  Everyone was very positive and listened to the ideas really well.  There was also some really good discussion about how the concepts could be varied and adapted into other markets.
On a personal note I have found the start of the project a bit stressful as I have been relocating cities, starting a new job and dealing with my father passing away quite suddenly all at once.
I think as a team we could have been a bit more mindful of meeting deadlines but I think we will definitely hit our stride as we settle into the project more.  We could have been more proactive about communicating via email in the lead up to the meeting and ensuring we were aware of the project milestones on practera.  
I think we have put clearer systems in place for meeting upcoming milestones- we have more clearly defined meeting times and are being more effective at allocating work within the group.  We will need to increase the amount of time we are spending on the project as the weeks progress to ensure we have the highest quality pitch completed by project end.

How do I feel?
From a CAMP perspective I’m really excited for a new adventure, meeting new people, developing an amazing solution to a problem and developing a great business case. I’m excited for the opportunity for another challenge and the potential for something significant and to have an impact on the world. 
I am partially concerned that CAMP will be a struggle organisationally due to the online format (it’s difficult to run a project when you’ve never met your team!). But all part of the challenge!

Emotionally I’m feeling pretty restless and constrained/contained at the moment due to competing priorities– family, work, personal desires, self-development etc. There is a lot going on from a family perspective that is taking up a lot of time and energy but is necessary. Im restless to be part of something significant and real, a real breakthrough.

Your key takeaway, learning, insight, a realisation or a perspective.
•	Everyone is creative, they need to be given the freedom to be creative and the incentive/vision. 
•	The problem is the hardest part. – what is the problem? Wicked problems – where to start
•	What constitutes a problem or an idea worth pursuing – there are so many!
•	Be kind to yourself. But be diligent 
•	Know yourself, know your ethics, stay within those boundaries but push all else. 

What is your Aha moment?
I dont think I have a single aha moment but a series – living in Korea, travelling through Borneo, a significant crisis of purpose, some FOMO, and a desire to protect. I think what triggered me to want to do things differently is the general publics apathy towards the environment and their apathy towards bettering themselves and discovering new things.

I now feel a stronger teamwork spirit and get a clearer idea of our team challenge. I would say that the changing is quite positive in terms of getting to know my team fellows better, finding ways to communicate more effectively and working as a team toward a common goal.

Key issues, team expectations and process

There are some key observations that we have addressed or are working on it. One is that my team members in China don’t have sufficient knowledge about Australia, but our challenge is essentially around Australians audiences. Second is that everyone has a busy schedule or often on the way, which makes it difficult to organise meeting. But I reckon these issues are quite normal in cross-nation and virtual projects. That’s why we need open, genuine and effective communication. We have talked about and acknowledged the concerns before designing our team rules accordingly to help to address the issues. For example, anyone cannot attend the meeting need to inform the team as early as possible so we may look at ways the person can contribute. To overcome the first concern, we tried to allocate tasks according to team member’s location and what their passion and talents are so that everyone can contribute fairly and perform. 

What could have been done differently?

During these few weeks, I have been working on target audience research and empathy map. We started it bit late, so in order to complete our task on time, we have to do our research really in a rush, though we all know we could have done it better. The lesson here is to start early, and also in future, CAMP facilitators may give better guidance and more support in the first few weeks. 

My realisation 

I think my team members are kind, keen to help, open-minded and confident. A member said that his English is not good enough but he would try his best. I really appreciate this attitude and respect this team member more. After all we come together to be better!

Although the major I am studying is Public Diplomacy which refers to ""the communication with foreign publics to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence"", I never had related practical experience before thus CAMP can be seen as my first practice in ""Public Diplomacy"". But I used to be attend an exchange program in 2012, during which time I studied and lived in Hong Kong Baptist University. After having class and doing kinds of work with local students and foreign students, I dare say I have some  experience in cultural exchange and ""transnational cooperation"". But this is still my first attempt as being a think tank member. The concept of ""think tank"" always seems to be mysterious and too high to be reached. Never thought that I could engage in one.

Maybe I am not a very good team player, but I am highly action motivated and conscientious. So I tend to fulfill a task myself and share the result and my opinion with my mates.

When I was an undergraduate, my major was Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language. As a result, I had a lot of courses in Education (learning and teaching skills), Chinese culture, Literature and art, Comparative cultural studies and so on. Personally, I like reading books and writing a lot and I write Chinese traditional poems and lyric prose in my spare time. I also published some literary criticism and articles about Comparative literature. Among all kinds of arts, I especially specialize in Chinese literature and cross-cultural communication. 

As a member from China, I have found that some videos or pages are hard to watch or visit. I wish I could view them all very fluently without ""climbing over the wall"". Maybe videos can be uploaded onto some Chinese website such as Youku or Sina, too.

I would very much like to make a good impression and feel like I have let myself and others down by being disorganised. CAMP is such an incredible opportunity and I was to be present for every moment. I realise that it’s a program where you will only get out as much as you put into it. 

I am also involved in another leadership program at Uni and it’s pleasing to see cross-overs with learnings and activities in both programs. I’m excited that I can use what I’m learning in each program to complement the other. The Bob Carr talk also made me very excited. It made me feel proud to be a part of a forum where so many inquisitive, bright, forward-looking minds are collaborating, although admittedly, a tiny bit intimidated.

Today, I feel very positive about my progress. I have chatted with teammates, joined the WeChat group, and helped to facilitate the first Adelaide meet-up, which I’m eagerly anticipating. Our group has a little bit of work to do to hit our first deadline, but I’m confident that I’m up to speed and will have learned from being a bit behind. Won’t happen again, that’s for sure!

The online platform experience is something I haven't deeply engaged with since university, and it has evolved a lot even since then (2012). Juggling learning this new terrain coupled with communicating across borders across the country and the globe is proving surprisingly challenging. I like to think that I am ""at home"" online, and spend a lot of time in apps such as Twitter and Instagram. However I'm now realising that there is a lot of output involved with those platforms – but not a lot of cross-engagement or challenge. I am not often out of my comfort zone. I have held back in connecting because I often what to know what I am doing before jumping in. But I have realised that I need to push and regularly communicate with my team and others in CAMP regardless of how I am feeling, as I am going to be able to best learn through doing, and persisting. Our first team meeting was exciting but awkward – we still haven’t all made contact as a collective (only 3 members were able to participate). However I felt a mutual energy from my colleagues and simply planning the next meeting felt like a good achievement. My preparation for the meeting has not been consistent and I am realising that I not only need to make time to do the CAMP work, I need to create mental space and conditions to engage creatively. The next steps will be to connect and focus outward, to work out how I fit into our collaborative space and how I can best contribute within this structure.

The CAMP O - week  is now complete and have bounced in and out of the platform to see what needs to be done. The most striking thing I have noticed is how well set up and user friendly the online platform. But more than that, the program feels well structured.  

So far I have not  progressed much on the CAMP platform. I continue to login for short bursts of time 5 - 15 mins. Which is not enough time to get my head in the zone and complete what is required. I think it would be helpful if it had a little calendar with dates on each section that says you need read this NOW and do this NOW and If you missed the deadline, it would turn red and you would have to catch up immediately! That is the problem with the online space, you do not feel the pressure like you do in the real world because no one is keeping you accountable. 

At this point in the experience, it still feels like we not quite began. I guess this is because I have not felt a great challenge hit me yet. But also because we are yet to have our first meeting. When our team exercises begin, it is critical that we do keep each other accountable with clear deadlines if we are going to achieve our goals.  I am so eager to get started. There is lots of uncertainty in my mind - what is our project about? What are we meant to be delivered? I hope we create our best work! These nerves are no unusally when I am about to begin something new.

I must admit, when ever I do login to the CAMP platform I find myself wondering straight to the Collabrate section of the page. This section is just so inspiring, because it reminds me that I am not alone. There are other young thinkers out there, passionate about Aus China and making their own path towards a better future for all.
